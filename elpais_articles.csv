" The human rights agency of the Organization of American States called on Colombia’s authorities to release people who were jailed for their participation in anti-government protests in 2021.In a report, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (IACHR) urged on Colombian authorities to release people who were unjustly jailed for their participation in the so-called “National Strike.”The office of Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa has been investigating hundreds of people who took part in the largely peaceful protests on all kinds of criminal charges, including terrorism.At least 150 people would still be in jail as a consequence of what human rights organizations and President Gustavo Petro have called a “persecution” of participants in the protests against former President Ivan Duque, one of Barbosa’s best friends.The recommendation to the competent authorities is to review the situation of those persons who may have been arbitrarily detained, so that they can follow these processes in freedom, with alternative measures to imprisonment that continue to allow the advancement of justice, but with greater participation of the people.IACHR representative Joel HernandezIs Colombia’s top mafia prosecutor targeting kids or gangsters?Deadly police violenceDuring the protests between April and July 2021, police arbitrarily arrested thousands of protesters and took part in the killing of at least 74 protesters, according to human rights organizations.In response to the violent crackdown, the IACHR investigated the alleged human rights violations and in July 2021 made 41 recommendations that would guarantee citizens’ right to protest peacefully.In a follow-up report on the progress of 28 of these recommendations, the agency found that only three recommendations were implemented substantially, 14 were partially implemented and 11 were pending implementation.‘Police used Bogota bus terminals to torture protesters’Persecution of protestersThe prosecution’s alleged persecution of protesters and refusal to investigate the police brutality during the protests have escalated tensions between Barbosa and human rights organizations.According to Alberto Yepes of the NGO Coordination Colombia-Europe-United States, 27 people were still missing and that the prosecution refused to investigate missing persons reports because they lacked data.Another 23 people were found dead after they went missing, human rights organization Defender La Libertad told Colombia Reports.Barbosa attacks human rights defendersBarbosa confirmed that the prosecution never investigated 195 missing persons reports because they “lacked information.”The chief prosecutor accused the NGO’s of “trying to torpedo the institutionality” by including 300 people “who never had gone missing” on a list of 625 missing persons that was given to the prosecution.According to Barbosa, none of the people who had been reported missing were ever in danger, ignoring the allegations that almost two dozen were found dead.Why so many people went missingThe vast majority of people who were reported as missing in the first weeks of the protests apparently could not be located because they had been arrested by police and detained in make-shift jails.According to Defender La Libertad, other people who reappeared said they were held hostage in police vans. human rightsnational strikeProsecutor General's Office ",https://colombiareports.com/oas-urges-colombia-to-release-people-arrested-over-2021-protests/,OAS urges Colombia to release people arrested over 2021 protests

" Colombia’s prosecutor general’s office on Friday refused to lift arrest warrants of paramilitary leaders, effectively blocking the government’s peace process.Deputy Prosecutor General Martha Marcera wrote Peace Commissioner Danilo Rueda that the government wasn’t allowed to hold peace talks with illegal armed groups like paramilitary organization AGC.The law does not enable the National Government to carry out negotiations or dialogues to enter into peace agreements with Organized Armed Groups [GAO’s] without political character or with armed high-impact organized crime structures. In other words, these organizations may only submit to justice.Prosecutor General’s OfficeThe prosecution additionally said that it was unable to “apply decree 1081 of 2015,” which regulated the appointment of  illegal armed groups’ delegates in order to facilitate a peace deal with guerrilla group FARC.Consequently, the government can’t begin negotiations with the AGC as part of its “Total Peace” policy, which seeks peace with guerrilla group ELN and the dismantling of other illegal organizations.Colombia’s congress gives green light to Petro’s “Total Peace” policyWhy the prosecution’s claims are deceptiveThe prosecution ignored the fact that Congress in November passed Law 2272, which explicitly allowed the government of President Gustavo Petro to hold “conversations” with illegal armed groups “in order to submit them to justice and to dismantle them.”Following the disbanding of the FARC in 2017, Decree 1081 exclusively applies to the ELN, which was granted political status in the 1990’s.Confusingly, the prosecution last week lifted the arrest warrants of delegates of a the “Southeastern Bloc, a guerrilla group that also has no political status.Colombia suspends arrest warrants for dissident FARC guerrillasGovernment responseIn a press statement, Peace Commissioner Danilo Rueda said that his request to lift the paramilitary delegates’ arrest warrants was in accordance with the “Total Peace” law that was passed by Congress in November.Interior Minister Alfonso Prada said that he would seek “a formal dialogue with the Prosecutor General’s Office,” and secure “exploratory” talks with the AGC and other illegal armed groups “in the coming hours or days.”Until then, the government can’t organize talks with the AGC or any other illegal armed groups rejected by the Prosecutor General’s Office.Mayor blow to peaceThe prosecution’s attempt to block talks with the AGC is its latest attempt to sabotage peace in Colombia.Former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez all but ended the peace process with the FARC after fabricating drug trafficking charges against demobilized guerrilla commanders.Martinez successor, Francisco Barbosa, has been fiercely criticized for his failure to investigate the mass killing of participants in the peace process.According to the Truth Commission, Colombia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has been infiltrated by paramilitary organizations and drug traffickers since the 1990’s.

" The United Nations will expand its monitoring of the implementation of a 2016 peace deal between Colombia’s government and the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group.The UN’s Security Council on Wednesday vowed to verify the implementation of a comprehensive rural reform and policies to improve the conditions of ethnic minorities.The rural reform and the improvement of conditions of ethnic minorities are key elements of the agreement that included the dismantling of the FARC in 2017.The UN’s mission in Colombia was already verifying the former guerrillas’ reintegration and the implementation of security policies for participants in the peace process.The demobilization and disarmament of the FARC was only a part of the agreement between the former guerrillas and former President Juan Manuel Santos.Main peace deal elementsPolitical participationRural reformDrug policyJustice for war crimesVictimsThe UN’s expanded mandate in ColombiaThe rural reform is one of the main elements of the peace deal and considered key to prevent perpetual violence that first erupted in the 1940’s.Another element if the amplification of rights for ethnic minorities like indigenous peoples and Colombia’s black minority who have disproportionally suffered from the armed conflict.The implementation of these parts of the peace deal was largely ignored by former President Ivan Duque, whose far-right party has opposed the peace process.Duque obstructed peace in Colombia ‘deliberately’Why the land reform mattersThe extremely unequal distribution of land and disputes about ownership have long been a major cause of violence and armed conflict in Colombia.The distribution of land has historically been extremely unequal in Colombia, but this was aggravated by the armed conflict and the preceding civil war.Some 8 million people, mainly farmers, were forcibly displaced by the violence. Between 2085 and 2004 alone, approximately 80,000 square kilometers of land was dispossessed from displaced farmers.This has devastated Colombia’s rural economy and left more than 500,000 victims who have demanded the return of their lands.Colombia’s peace deals in depth: Rural reformWhat’s wrong with the ethnic minorities?Colombia’s native peoples and descendants from African slaves make up approximately 15% of the country’s population.The armed conflict affected them more than Colombia’s white or mestizo majority because of the location of indigenous and Afro-Colombian territories and deeply-rooted racism.The peace deal vowed to improve the rights of these ethnic minorities as well as Colombia’s tiny gypsy minority, and improve their living conditions.This part of the peace deal has also been largely ignored while newly formed illegal armed groups have continued to subject ethnic minorities to violence and armed conflict.UN expert rejects violence against indigenous in southwest ColombiaRenewed efforts to make peacePresident Gustavo Petro has vowed to implement a “Total Peace” policy, which seeks to implement the peace deal with he FARC and additional policies to end violence that surged during the peace process.In order to achieve this, the Petro administration asked the UN’s Security Council to also monitor the implementation of the rural reform and measures to improve ethnic minorities’ rights in October last year.The full implementation of the peace deal is expected to take at least a decade. agricultureland reformpeace processrural reformUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/un-to-monitor-indigenous-rights-and-land-reform-in-colombia/,UN to monitor indigenous rights and land reform in Colombia
" Colombia’s ELN guerrillas claimed that the government’s decision to declare a bilateral ceasefire created a “crisis” in ongoing peace talks.The guerrillas’ claim comes days after the government of Mexico said that it wouldn’t be ready to host negotiations until February 10.President Gustavo Petro and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro agreed over the weekend to maintain the talks in Caracas where they began.According to newspaper El Espectador, ELN and government negotiators are trying to push forward talks to discuss the alleged crisis over the ceasefire.What crisis?President Gustavo Petro claimed on New Year’s Eve that the government had agreed to a six-month bilateral ceasefire with five illegal armed groups, including the ELN.The ELN subsequently showed that this was false and said that it refused to any ceasefire that wasn’t agreed as part of the peace talks.Peace commissioner Danilo Rueda and guerrilla group “Southeastern Bloc” subsequently suggested there was no ceasefire agreement with any group.The president unilaterally decided to make the unilateral ceasefires declared by the five armed groups in December bilateral by also ordering an end of military operations.After the ELN’s refusal to a bilateral ceasefire, Petro revoked the order to suspend attacks on the guerrillas, effectively making them the military’s sole target.Unless one of the other illegal armed groups violate the ceasefire, the military will avoid confrontations with them until June 30.Colombia’s ceasefire is real, but is it bilateral?Why the ELN is being so difficultThe difference between the ELN and the other groups is that the guerrillas are the only ones involved in formal peace talks.These talks follow an agenda agreed in 2017 between the ELN and former President Juan Manuel Santos, but were suspended in 2018 by former President Ivan Duque.The talks with the other groups have yet to begin and are not about peace, because they are not at war with the State, unlike the ELN.Their violence is mainly due to their opposition to peace deals made in the past with the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and paramilitary organization AUC.The ELN has repeatedly said they have nothing to do with Petro’s attempts to negotiate an end to violence by these groups. armed conflictceasefireELNpeace talks ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-eln-guerrillas-claim-ceasefire-triggered-crisis-in-peace-talks/,Colombia’s ELN guerrillas claim ceasefire triggered crisis in peace talks

" Police and prosecutors in Colombia continue to investigate who ordered the assassination of one of Paraguay’s top anti-mafia prosecutors in May last year.Police in Colombia, Venezuela and El Salvador have arrested 10 alleged participants in the plot to assassinate Paraguayan prosecutor Marcelo Pecci on May 10 last year.Police and the Prosecutor General’s Office claim that associates of the Medellin mafia took a week to recruit an assassin squad and plan Pecci’s assassination in the Caribbean city of Cartagena.Who ordered an financed the hit has yet to be clarified, however, especially after the extradition of one of the main suspects from El Salvador on Saturday.The Colombo-Venezuelan hit squadMargareth Chacon (Image: El Salvador’s Justice and Public Security Ministry)Following the extradition of Margareth Chacon, nine of the members of the Colombo-Venezuelan hit squad are in jail in Colombia and one in Venezuela.Chacon arrived in Bogota almost a week after the arrest of her husband, Andres Perez, and her brother-in-law, Ramon Perez.The Perez brothers plead guilty to homicide after seeing compelling evidence indicating that they coordinated the 10-day operation that ended Pecci’s life with Chacon.The latest detainee denied her involvement in the assassination plot.The intelligence operationThe Perez brothers (Image: Prosecutor General’s Office)Chacon and the Perez brothers were arrested after a six-month intelligence operation by police intelligence unit DIJIN and the prosecution’s Technical Investigation Unit.The three weren’t considered suspects until the arrest of the assassination squad’s alleged logistics chief, Francisco Luis Correa, in June last year.The Perez brothers knew Correa because they used to be members of the now-defunct paramilitary group “Los Paisas,”  according to the prosecution.Shortly after his arrest, Correa told investigators that Ramon Perez called him about a “job” on April 30 last year and specified that the job was killing Pecci during a meeting in Medellin two days later.Pecci had to die “because the prosecutor was being a nuisance for their boss” in Paraguay, according to Correa’s testimony.He imprisoned his brother for four years and the prosecutor was going after his assets and drug trafficking, they told me.Correa testimonyFollowing Correa’s accusations, DIJIN had a second look at CCTV footage from Cartagena, which allegedly confirmed that Chacon and the Perez brothers were in Cartagena on the day of Pecci’s assassination.In the meantime, intelligence officials began tracking the movements of Chacon and the Perez brothers.Migration Colombia’s registry showed that Chacon had traveled to El Salvador more than 100 times and had traveled to Venezuela and Panama on multiple occasions.According to DIJIN, Chacon frequently wired money from El Salvador to her husband in Bogota, suggesting that she may not be the housewife that she claimed to be.The leads abroadThe evidence and testimonies against Chacon and the Perez brothers suggest that they are part of an drug trafficking network that doesn’t just operate in Paraguay, but throughout Latin America.Two days after the assassination, former National Police director Jorge Luis Vargas said that the PCC, an organized crime group from Brazil, was suspected of ordering the assassination of Pecci.In August, President Gustavo Petro said that fugitive Uruguayan drug trafficker Sebastian Marset had ordered the murder.Marset, an alleged boss of the First Uruguayan Cartel (PCU), rejected this allegation.Last week, newspaper El Tiempo reported that authorities suspected Miguel Insfran, a fugitive PCU boss from Paraguay. of having ordered Pecci’s assassination.According to El Tiempo, its intelligence sources believed that Insfran may be hiding in Colombia’s northern La Guajira province.The latest narco who allegedly ordered the Cartagena hit may just as well have fled to Venezuela or El Salvador, the newspaper reported.Meanwhile, authorities have yet to speculate about the origin of the $320,000 the Perez brothers allegedly gave Correa to finance the assassination.

" The United Nations will expand its monitoring of the implementation of a 2016 peace deal between Colombia’s government and the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group.The UN’s Security Council on Wednesday vowed to verify the implementation of a comprehensive rural reform and policies to improve the conditions of ethnic minorities.The rural reform and the improvement of conditions of ethnic minorities are key elements of the agreement that included the dismantling of the FARC in 2017.The UN’s mission in Colombia was already verifying the former guerrillas’ reintegration and the implementation of security policies for participants in the peace process.The demobilization and disarmament of the FARC was only a part of the agreement between the former guerrillas and former President Juan Manuel Santos.Main peace deal elementsPolitical participationRural reformDrug policyJustice for war crimesVictimsThe UN’s expanded mandate in ColombiaThe rural reform is one of the main elements of the peace deal and considered key to prevent perpetual violence that first erupted in the 1940’s.Another element if the amplification of rights for ethnic minorities like indigenous peoples and Colombia’s black minority who have disproportionally suffered from the armed conflict.The implementation of these parts of the peace deal was largely ignored by former President Ivan Duque, whose far-right party has opposed the peace process.Duque obstructed peace in Colombia ‘deliberately’Why the land reform mattersThe extremely unequal distribution of land and disputes about ownership have long been a major cause of violence and armed conflict in Colombia.The distribution of land has historically been extremely unequal in Colombia, but this was aggravated by the armed conflict and the preceding civil war.Some 8 million people, mainly farmers, were forcibly displaced by the violence. Between 2085 and 2004 alone, approximately 80,000 square kilometers of land was dispossessed from displaced farmers.This has devastated Colombia’s rural economy and left more than 500,000 victims who have demanded the return of their lands.Colombia’s peace deals in depth: Rural reformWhat’s wrong with the ethnic minorities?Colombia’s native peoples and descendants from African slaves make up approximately 15% of the country’s population.The armed conflict affected them more than Colombia’s white or mestizo majority because of the location of indigenous and Afro-Colombian territories and deeply-rooted racism.The peace deal vowed to improve the rights of these ethnic minorities as well as Colombia’s tiny gypsy minority, and improve their living conditions.This part of the peace deal has also been largely ignored while newly formed illegal armed groups have continued to subject ethnic minorities to violence and armed conflict.UN expert rejects violence against indigenous in southwest ColombiaRenewed efforts to make peacePresident Gustavo Petro has vowed to implement a “Total Peace” policy, which seeks to implement the peace deal with he FARC and additional policies to end violence that surged during the peace process.In order to achieve this, the Petro administration asked the UN’s Security Council to also monitor the implementation of the rural reform and measures to improve ethnic minorities’ rights in October last year.The full implementation of the peace deal is expected to take at least a decade. agricultureland reformpeace processrural reformUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/un-to-monitor-indigenous-rights-and-land-reform-in-colombia/,UN to monitor indigenous rights and land reform in Colombia
" Colombia’s ELN guerrillas claimed that the government’s decision to declare a bilateral ceasefire created a “crisis” in ongoing peace talks.The guerrillas’ claim comes days after the government of Mexico said that it wouldn’t be ready to host negotiations until February 10.President Gustavo Petro and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro agreed over the weekend to maintain the talks in Caracas where they began.According to newspaper El Espectador, ELN and government negotiators are trying to push forward talks to discuss the alleged crisis over the ceasefire.What crisis?President Gustavo Petro claimed on New Year’s Eve that the government had agreed to a six-month bilateral ceasefire with five illegal armed groups, including the ELN.The ELN subsequently showed that this was false and said that it refused to any ceasefire that wasn’t agreed as part of the peace talks.Peace commissioner Danilo Rueda and guerrilla group “Southeastern Bloc” subsequently suggested there was no ceasefire agreement with any group.The president unilaterally decided to make the unilateral ceasefires declared by the five armed groups in December bilateral by also ordering an end of military operations.After the ELN’s refusal to a bilateral ceasefire, Petro revoked the order to suspend attacks on the guerrillas, effectively making them the military’s sole target.Unless one of the other illegal armed groups violate the ceasefire, the military will avoid confrontations with them until June 30.Colombia’s ceasefire is real, but is it bilateral?Why the ELN is being so difficultThe difference between the ELN and the other groups is that the guerrillas are the only ones involved in formal peace talks.These talks follow an agenda agreed in 2017 between the ELN and former President Juan Manuel Santos, but were suspended in 2018 by former President Ivan Duque.The talks with the other groups have yet to begin and are not about peace, because they are not at war with the State, unlike the ELN.Their violence is mainly due to their opposition to peace deals made in the past with the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and paramilitary organization AUC.The ELN has repeatedly said they have nothing to do with Petro’s attempts to negotiate an end to violence by these groups. armed conflictceasefireELNpeace talks ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-eln-guerrillas-claim-ceasefire-triggered-crisis-in-peace-talks/,Colombia’s ELN guerrillas claim ceasefire triggered crisis in peace talks

" Colombia’s Foreign Ministry condemned far-right attacks on government buildings in Brazil and called on other governments to do the same.In a message on social media platform Twitter, the Foreign Ministry said the government “condemns the attack on democracy” in Brazil and invited other regional governments to do the same.President Gustavo Petro said on Twitter that “fascism decided to have a coup” after “the right failed to keep the pact of no violence” to secure the peaceful transition of power to leftist President Luis Inacio Lula.Petro added that “it is urgent for an OAS [Organization of American States]  meeting if it wants to continue existing as an institution,” claiming that the regional organization “has lost its way.”Like the Colombian president, OAS Secretary General Luis Almargo “condemned the attack on Brazil’s institutions,” and the “fascist” and “direct attack on democracy.”Petro stressed that the “American convention” between countries from the hemisphere “should acquire more judicial mechanisms” that could try those behind attacks on democracy like those in Brazil on Sunday.Latin American fascism has already bled the continent dry, produced military coups and millions of people in exile.

" The government of Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro said Wednesday the security forces will resume attacks against ELN guerrillas.The decision followed an announcement of the guerrillas in which they refused to an immediate bilateral ceasefire together with four other illegal armed groups.Petro claimed on Saturday his government had come to an agreement with the ELN and the other groups to cease fire for at least six months.This was false, the ELN said on Tuesday, adding that they will negotiate a bilateral ceasefire during peace talks that are set to resume later this month.Interior Minister Alfonso Prada said that the decrees to cease fire against paramilitary organization AGC, two organizations formed by dissidents of the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group and organized crime groups would remain in place.Prada said the government hoped the ELN would agree to a bilateral ceasefire as soon as peace talks have resumed in Mexico.The ELN’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire with the security forces is a disaster for civilians living in guerrilla-controlled territory.Particularly in areas where other illegal armed groups dispute the guerrillas’ territorial control, chances are relatively high for armed conflict.The ELN announcement was also a major embarrassment of Petro and Prada, whose claim to have reached agreements with Colombia’s largest illegal armed groups turned out to be false.The government resumed peace talks with the guerrillas and began negotiations with other illegal armed groups in an attempt to end violence that resurged after a 2016 peace deal with the FARC. armed conflictceasefireELNpeace processpeace talks ",https://colombiareports.com/petro-suspends-ceasefire-with-colombias-eln-guerrillas/,Petro suspends ceasefire with Colombia’s ELN guerrillas
" The governments of Colombia and the United States will negotiate revisions to their controversial “free” trade agreement, the trade minister confirmed on Tuesday.According to the Colombia’s ambassador to Washington DC, Luis Gilberto Murillo, bilateral talks about possible revisions to the so-called “US-Colombia Free Trade Pact” (FTA) are planned for May.Murillo said in December that the government of President Gustavo Petro has been talking to different organizations about revising the 2012 treaty the process after taking office in August last year.In the same period, the government involved more than 50 regional organizations in the formulation of its economic development plan that will be presented to Congress next month.Trade Minister German Umaña stressed that the government doesn’t seek to “renegotiate” the FTA, but negotiate mutually beneficial “adjustments” in “friendly talks.”The free trade disasterThe allegedly planned trade talks are the consequence of widespread criticism on the FTA, which was followed by a 50% drop in exports to the US that were supposed to benefit from the deal.Exports to USThe US Congressional Research Service (USCRS) said in May last year that the treaty was also expected to “increase foreign direct investment in Colombia,” which never happened.In fact, American investment dropped from $2.2 billion in 2011 to $1.9 billion in 2021, according to the central bank.Colombia’s farmers claim government lifting import tariffs puts domestic food production at riskThe FTA and Colombia’s farmersThe FTA is particularly loathed in the countryside where farmers can’t compete American food imports because of a lack of infrastructure and American subsidies on agriculture.The USCRS confirmed that some 200,000 farmers rose up in 2013 after they found themselves being displaced by major agro-industrial corporations.Ahead of the treaty, Colombia’s Agriculture Ministry warned that the elimination of tariffs on staple crops could condemn farmers to “migration to the cities or other countries (especially the United States), working in drug cultivation zones, or affiliating with illegal armed groups.”Between 2011 and 2021, farmland used to cultivate coca went up 219% and Colombia’s potential cocaine exports went up 569%, statistics of the National Police and the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime indicate.Government statistics additionally show that American companies since 2012 wired more than $30 billion to Colombia for goods that, according to DANE, were never exported.A former US prosecutor confirmed in 2020 that “the illegal drug trade depends on shadow financial networks to move drug traffickers’ profits into our banking system and across our borders.”How money laundering inflates US-Colombia trade statisticsHappy bankers and exportersExtract of the 2017 indictment of a banker whose office was used to launder money from the US.Despite evidence indicating that the FTA destroyed Colombia’s agriculture sector and boosted cocaine exports to the US, neither Washington DC nor Bogota want to renegotiate the FTA.The thing is that the deal also allowed American corporations to increase exports to Colombia by more than 47% since 2011, according to the US Census Bureau.Colombian President Petro needs the US trade deal and his American counterpart Joe Biden in order to implement his National Development Plan (PND), which seeks to reverse the FTA’s negative effects.We are not doing a renegotiation, what we are doing is a friendly conversation with our partner with terms that each chapter of the Free Trade Agreement talks about, in order to improve the conditions for both countries… in the sense that trade and investment will be more transparent, agile and convenient.Trade Minister German UmañaMurillo has been lobbying in Washington DC to hold FTA talks before the end of May, because this is the Colombian Congress’ deadline to approve the PND.What is the PNDThe National Development Plan is arguably the most important proposal of every Colombian government as it sets out its socio-economic strategy for the coming four years. Petro’s PND is particularly ambitious because it includes a radical economic reform that seeks to end Colombia’s armed conflict through economic development in regions that have been ravaged by violence for decades. According to the government, the pending PND was formulated with the input of more than 50 rural communities that are most affected by arms conflict and organized crime.

" Contrary to claims made by President Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s government has made no ceasefire agreements with any  illegal armed group.Petro said on Saturday that “we have agreed a bilateral ceasefire” with guerrilla group ELN, paramilitary organization AGC, two groups formed by dissidents of the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and drug trafficking organization “Los Pachenca until the end of June.The president on Wednesday ordered the military to resume attacks against the ELN after the guerrilla group said they never agreed to a bilateral ceasefire.On that same day, however, Peace Commissioner Danilo Rueda suggested that none of the illegal armed groups had formally agreed to a uphold a bilateral ceasefire with the government.Petro just suspended military operations after the illegal armed groups agreed to unilaterally suspend attacks and appoint delegates for talks.The ELN, which is holding separate peace talks, was never involved in this process.Colombia’s ELN guerrillas deny bilateral ceasefire pactOnly “Southeastern Bloc” confirms bilateral ceasefireGuerrillas of the CCO, an ally of the Southwestern Bloc (Screenshot: YouTube)In a statement, Rueda said that the government delegates had only sat down with representatives of FARC dissident group “Southeastern Bloc,” which subsequently declared a unilateral ceasefire on December 24, which would end on Monday.Rueda reportedly had been in contact with FARC dissident group “Segunda Marquetalia, the AGC and Los Pachenca, who had agreed to an “exploratory phase” proposed by the peace commissioner in December.Petro’s ceasefire was “mainly a response to communities and social organizations asking for peace in this regions,” said Rueda.In a statement that became public on Thursday the FARC dissident group confirmed they would “commit to the bilateral ceasefire,” but added that such agreements “must be ratified through the construction of a route that mainly involves the actors in the conflict.”AGCOn December 26, the peace commissioner said that the AGC was one of the illegal armed groups that had agreed to the “exploratory phase” in which “I asked them not to kill, torture or [forcibly] disappear anyone.In a December 30 statement, the AGC that the paramilitaries would “maintain the order that was issued to our organization about the [unilateral] ceasefire… we decreed” in August last year.The AGC has been accused of violating their August ceasefire, particularly in the central Antioquia and Santander provinces.In their latest pamphlet, however, the paramilitaries announced that also designated delegates “who will sit down at the table with delegates of the government and the Ombudsman’s Office” as requested by Rueda.Segunda MarquetaliaLike the AGC, the Segunda Marquetalia allegedly declared a unilateral ceasefire after agreeing to the exploratory phase with the government, Rueda said on December 26.In a video message that was published on December 27, a unit of the Segunda Marquetalia reiterated their “absolute and strict determination to take part in the ‘Total Peace’ process” of the government and called on the Southeastern Bloc to negotiate a bilateral ceasefire between the rival guerrilla groups.In a December 30 press release, the central command of the FARC dissident group said that “we agree to silence the rifles” in order to “choose the best way to peace” and announced the names of three delegates for its “eventual peace negotiation with the government, once the exploratory talks are concluded,” implying that they would be willing to comply with Petro’s bilateral ceasefire.Los Pachenca / ACSNACSN fighters (Screenshot: YouTube)Also Los Pachenca apparently agreed to Rueda’s request to diminish violence and have “ratified their commitment to the bilateral ceasefire,” which would significantly reduce violence in the Caribbean region where they have been at war with the AGC.The group had already asked one of the former commanders of the now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC to be their intermediary in talks with the government ahead of the peace commissioner’s “exploratory phase” request.

The report failed to mention a single conviction in any of these femicide cases.Consequently, many female victims of abuse fail to report this to the authorities due to a lack of confidence in the prosecution and a fear that filing a criminal complaint could trigger possibly lethal relations from their victimizers.The criminal policy disasters that facilitate crime in Colombia violence against womenwomenwomen's rights ",https://colombiareports.com/violence-against-women-in-colombia-saw-sharp-increase-in-2022/,Violence against women in Colombia saw sharp increase in 2022

process.Instead, the unit of organized crime prosecutor Javier Garcia has been seeking the mass prosecution of people who took part in mass protests against former President Ivan Duque in 2019 and 2021 on criminal charges that include terrorism.Garcia would know as much about criminal law as the next guy as the former law school buddy of Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa studied

(Image: Adriaan Alsema)The prosecution’s organized crime unit failed to successfully prosecute a single member of one of Colombia’s illegal armed groups in the past year, according to the prosecution’s annual report to Congress.Instead, the unit of the former law school buddy of chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa has been trying to prosecute more than 170 of the more than 2,000 people who were arrested during and after the protests that erupted in April last year.The mass arrests and attempts to press charges were rejected by judges, but DEDOC was able to secure five convictions, despite the apparent help of its newly founded “Elite Group Against Terrorism”(GECET), according to investigative journalism website Cuestion Publica.Human rights defenders have lambasted the prosecution for failing to prosecute cops accused of assassinating between 25 and 44 people during the protests while allegedly fabricating charges against protesters who allegedly joined so-called “Primera Linea” groups to protect others against deadly police violence.Colombia desperately implies peaceful protesters were armed to the teethOne Medellin resident was arrested in July last year and charged with terrorism for broadcasting protests live on social media “in which he would have instigated violence,” according to Garcia, whose team has yet to call the protester to trial.The United Nations’ human rights chief in Colombia, Juliette de Rivero, rejected the stigmatization of the Primera Linea groups in September, stressing that criminal charges like “conspiracy and terrorism, according to international norms and human rights standards,” were “excessive.”Dozens of arrested protesters have been waiting to be called to court for more than half a year while judges ordered the release of dozens who were called to court on trumped up charges.In a report to Congress, the prosecution praised the help of GECET, and the newly founded “counterterrorism” agencies CI3T and GRATE of police intelligence unit DIJIN for imprisoning the protesters.Colombia seeks controversial new spy agency to confront ‘terrorist threat’The prosecution messProsecutor General Francisco Barbosa (Screenshot: Twitter)The prosecution has made an utter mess destroying its organized crime unit in its apparent attempt to criminalize peaceful protest and all but legalizing police killings.In an April 2020 letter to the United Nations, the Duque administration denied that the DECOC was supposed to dismantle illegal armed groups and reduce organized crime, but was created for the “persecution of terrorism and associated crimes,” including the “violent radicalization of university students.”Seven months later, Duque and Barbosa announced the creation of an elite group to fight “sophisticated organizations” with an “urban war doctrine based on the recruitment of youth” that sought “chaos” by “infiltrating social protests.”Whether they were talking about the CEGET is uncertain as the alleged 2018 decree that created the unit and the alleged January 2020 resolution that laid out its priorities are missing from online government archives.In fact, the CEGET doesn’t even appear anywhere on the prosecution’s official organizational chart.Foreign support?According to the prosecution, its “counterterrorism” unit that is accused of political persecution received the support of the European Union in 2019 when the CEGET had yet to formulate its priorities.The United Nations’ Counter-Terrorism Center began cooperating with the CEGET in 2020 already, the prosecution told Congress.The International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section of the United States of the American embassy in Bogota is preparing a training for the 21 alleged prosecutors of the alleged anti-terrorism unit and spent almost $23 million since 2019 on the organized crime unit and the Special Investigations Unit (UEI), which was created in 2017 to investigate the mass killing of social leaders, according to the prosecution.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed last year that American support for Colombia included “training local prosecutors and judges so they have the capacity to try and win cases,” but said nothing about helping the prosecution unit accused of persecuting political activists.Military intelligence spied on protest organizers in Colombia, US and

" President Gustavo Petro is struggling to find the money that is needed to prevent that millions of Colombia’s poorest families will be left without relief next month.According to Petro, the government doesn’t have the money to continue the so-called “Solidarity Income” program, which allowed some 4 million families to receive a $40 monthly stipend since 2020.Former President Ivan Duque created this program to mitigate the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the approximately 20 million people who somehow survived with less than $74 a month last year.But according to Petro, Duque failed to allocate funds that would allow the program to continue after the end of this month, however.Congress approved the new government’s budget for 2023 in October, but has yet to approve a tax reform that would boost tax revenue with $5.5 billion in 2023 and allow increased spending on poverty reduction.In the meantime, nobody appears to have a clue what to do about the impending crisis for the millions of people that relied on the Solidary Income program to buy food.According to Social Prosperity Department (DPS) director Cielo Rusinque, her department received a provisional budget of $83 million (COP400 billion) to finance its “shock plan against hunger” in December.The emergency budget would allow the social security agency to transfer a $104 (COP500K) stipend to some 2 million poor families next month.What will happen to the 2 million families that were apparently left out of the “shock plan” is a mystery.Whether the government will have money to prevent a major surge in extreme poverty in January is also unclear.The government “is making a huge effort to secure the income for the poorest households,” said Rusinque.Neither the DPS chief nor the president have given any details about this alleged effort to secure life-saving aid for the impending hunger crisis.According to national statistics agency DANE, more than 20 million Colombians survived with less than $74 a month in 2021. hungerpoverty ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-struggling-to-prevent-hunger-crisis/,Colombia struggling to prevent hunger crisis
" An armed confrontation between illegal armed groups left 18 alleged guerrillas dead in the south of Colombia, authorities confirmed on Sunday.According to the Ombudsman’s Office, the victims that fell in the fighting on Saturday were members of two rival guerrilla groups, the “Border Commandos” and the “Southwestern Bloc” in the Putumayo province.A spokesperson for the rural communities where the clashes took place said that locals were forced to collect the dead and decried the lack of response from authorities.The community was forced to gather the bodies of the dead combatants that were left lying in different places in the mountain and the report was passed on to the authorities that did not respond and did not implement any of the institutional routes that correspond to the case. Human rights defender Yuri QuinteroAuthorities urged to take actionThe Ombudsman’s Office on Sunday asked the security forces and the prosecution to send personnel to Puerto Guzman, the municipality where the incident took place, in response to the latest outbreak of violence.According to the human rights office, the local were waiting for the authorities to identify the corpses that had been brought to a local cemetery.General Fredy Fernando Gamba, the commander of the 27th Jungle Brigade of the National Army, said Sunday that he knew there had been fighting in Puerto Guzman but, despite the reports from the locals and the human rights office, “we don’t know the number of deaths.”The regional army commander said that his forces were “in the process of moving troops to the location and verify what happened.”Southern Colombia living in terror as turf war over drug trade escalatesThe war for PutumayoThe deadly confrontation occurred after years of armed conflict between the Border Commandos, a groups that controls the drug trade on the border with Ecuador, and the Southwestern Bloc, which has been trying to assume control over the region for years.Both groups largely consist of former members of the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC who refused to lay down their weapons as part of a peace deal made with the government in 2016.The rise of the “Border Commandos” in southern ColombiaThe security forces are virtually absent in the Putumayo jungles that historically have been controlled by guerrilla groups.The region is of strategic importance for these groups as Putumayo is one of Colombia’s main producers of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine.The region’s coca cultivation regions are located in the vicinity of routes that allow traffickers to move the illicit drugs to Ecuador and Peru, and Pacific port cities in the southwest of Colombia. armed conflictBorder CommandosFARC dissidentsPutumayoSoutheastern Bloc ",https://colombiareports.com/18-killed-in-southern-colombia-turf-war-between-guerrillas/,18 killed in southern Colombia turf war between guerrillas
" Multiple high-profile arrests and criminal investigations suggest that Colombia’s military has become one of the main arms suppliers of the country’s guerrilla groups.Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez said earlier this month that “there are internal investigations in the army” after a flurry of arrests suggesting that corrupt members of the security forces have been arming the country’s illegal armed groups.The recent arrests discredited unsubstantiated claims made by British news agency Reuters, which reported in April that Mexican drug cartels were bartering weapons for cocaine with illegal armed groups from Colombia.“The majority of the 1,478 long-range weapons confiscated from armed groups in 2020 and 2021 were produces abroad,” said Reuters based on a police intelligence report.Police intelligence gave Reuters the report less than two weeks after the arrest of six members of the military who allegedly were providing illegal armed groups with weapons and ammunition that had been stolen from military storages by an arms trafficking network operating inside the National Army.“Operation Honor”In October, prosecutors arrested another 12 suspects for allegedly selling handguns, rifles, machine guns, ammunition and even grenade launchers that were stolen from military compounds between 2017 and earlier this year.The prosecution initially said that it had “abundant forensic evidence,” to prove that two Cali cops had the capacity to provide the FARC dissidents “up to 40 long-range Galil, R15 and M16 rifles,” and all kinds of ammunition “within three weeks.”Before the end of the month, prosecutors arrested another eight arms traffickers in seven cities throughout Colombia in a joint operation with the counterintelligence unit of the military.This operation allegedly revealed that the arms trafficking network had been stealing arms and ammunition from the same military compounds that had been flagged by the prosecution in March and had sold the weaponry to illegal armed groups like that of FARC dissident leader “Ivan Mordisco.”Two convicted arms traffickers “maintained contact with officials in the different battalions to continue acquiring weaponry on a major scale,” said the prosecution.“Initially we got almost everything from Indumil,” the Colombian military’s weapons manufacturer, testified one of the detainees, according to transcripts obtained by Caracol Radio.“Later we obtained ‘[the weaponry] at the Provisions Batallion that’s located in the north of Bogota,” the alleged arms trafficker reportedly added.The arms and ammunition were subsequently sent to a network of front companies and homes before being sold to illegal armed groups, according to the prosecution.The implicated colonelThe latest wave of arrests came a year after the arrest of Colonel Oscar Alexander Amado as part of “Operation Honor,” a counterintelligence operation carried out with organized crime prosecutors.Amado’s alleged arms trafficking ring was discovered in November 2020 when prosecutors found a shipment of almost 15,000 5.56mm cartridges that were allegedly meant for Mordisco’s “Carlos Patiño Front” in a warehouse just outside the Tolemaida base.The ammunition bust in Melgar was the second largest in the history of Colombia and confirmed suspicions that corrupt elements within the military were arming FARC dissidents and other illegal armed groups.Curiously, Amado was released in February because the prosecution failed to press criminal charges.Old evidenceIndumil main office in BogotaWhat may be more curious is that the military had pretty solid evidence indicting that its weapons manufacturer and army units were involved in arms trafficking before May 2019 already.In fact, the leaked results of a counterintelligence investigation carried out between 2016 and 2019 included a wiretap transcript in which an alleged Indumil employee was negotiating the illegal “transfer of weapons” to the 4th Brigade in Medellin.According to the Medellin District Attorney’s Office, the report contained “information about the possible existence of a criminal network inside the National Army, in charge of granting special gun permits without complying to the legal requisites, mainly to illegal armed groups.”“The network operates from the Commercial Firearms Control Department (DCCA) located in Bogota, some Regional Commercial Arms Control offices, some 4th Brigade officials and some individuals in charge of contaminating and bribing the officials,” the Medellin prosecutors concluded at the time.Despite the evidence indicating that the DCCA was trafficking arms illegally to corrupt military officials throughout Colombia, authorities only arrested the then-commander of the 4th Brigade.  armed conflictarms traffickingcorruptionmilitary ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-investigating-military-arms-trafficking-for-guerrillas/,Colombia’s military trafficking arms for guerrillas: prosecution

" Colombia’s peso has lost 20% of its value against the dollar so far this year, which is threatening the government’s budget.The most recent devaluation of Colombia’s currency made the US dollar on Wednesday reach 4,762 pesos, a historic high.The value of the American currency in Colombia has already gone up 20% since January 1 when one dollar traded for 4,065 pesos.The devaluation of the peso has helped soar inflation and threatens to shrink Colombia’s gross domestic product (GDP) next year, according to President Gustavo Petro.The unprecedented devaluation of the peso could benefit some export sectors, but also push inflation of consumer products that rely on imports.The Comptroller General’s Office also warned about the government’s outstanding debt, which reached $75.2 billion or 50.6% of Colombia’s GDP in July, according to the central bank.According to Comptroller General Carlos Hernan Rodriguez, the government of former President Ivan Duque increased government debt with 6.3% of Colombia’s GDP in 2021.This is now affecting the budget of his successor, who is expected to pay interest on this debt in dollars with the pesos that are in the national budget.The debt payments of the national government in 2021 increased COP73.84 trillion ($15.6 billion), 6.3% of GDP, of which COP41.16 trillion ($8.6 billion) corresponded to amortizations and COP32.68 trillion ($7 billion) to interest and commission payments.Comptroller General Carlos Hernan RodriguezSo, the more dollars the government has to spend on debt, the less pesos it can spend on everything else.Economist Edgar Jimenez of Bogota’s Los Andes University told newspaper La Republica that the price of the dollar in could soar to 4,800 and even 5,000 pesos before the end of the year.Colombia’s government and central bank can’t do little to change this as the value of the peso depends largely on actions taken by the United States’ central bank, the Federal Reserve.The fundamental factor is inflation and some signs of the slowdown that this economy like employment statistics. If these are positive, the market expects is that the Federal Reserve will no longer have to raise [interest] rates this aggressively. This would make the US dollar less attractive, which would cause Colombia to see a decline again.Economist Edgar JimenezIf the Federal Reserve continues to raise its interest rate and global oil prices also continue to disappoint, Jimenez said, the Colombian peso could lose even more value.Colombia’s Finance Ministry said Tuesday that it would cut back on the sale of government bonds next year in the hope that this will reduce the government’s dependency on foreign debt to finance its budget.Colombia’s dollar woes are significant, but not as bad as those of Venezuela, whose bolivar lost 44.6% of its value against the dollar, and Argentina, whose peso lost 32.8% of its value so far this year. 2023 budgetcurrencyeconomyforeign debt ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-peso-could-end-up-losing-25-against-us-dollar-in-2021/,Colombia’s peso could end up losing 25% against US dollar in 2022
" The area used for coca cultivation and Colombia’s potential cocaine production soared to record heights in 2021, according to the United Nations.In its annual report, the UN’s Office on Drugs and Crime registered a 43% increase in coca cultivation, which reached 204,000 hectares.Coca cultivationThe potential cocaine production was 1,400 metric tons, by far the highest number in history.Based on police interdiction numbers, Colombia’s potential cocaine exports would have increased to 731 metric tons.Potential cocaine exportsThe booming drug trade eradicated the effects of former President Ivan Duque, whose counternarcotics policy focused on forced eradication of coca.The UN’s monitoring also revealed changing cultivation and production methods, according to UNODC Americas director Candice Welsch.In an interview with newspaper El Espectador, Welsch said coca cultivation is increasingly concentrated along the Pacific coast in the west, the border with Ecuador in the south and the border with Venezuela in the east.Welsh also said that drug traffickers increasingly depend on industrial coca plantations rather than small plots managed by ordinary farmers.The increased production of cocaine coincided with a global increase in demand for the illicit drug, particularly in the United States and Europe.President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August, has promised radical changes in the government’s drug policy, which would include far-reaching rural reforms and investments in economic development.Petro has additionally called on other countries to end the prohibition of drugs, which would allow a regulation of the cocaine trade that’s been a major player in the Colombian economy since the 1970’s. coca cultivationcocainedrug traffickingUNODC ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-cocaine-production-soared-to-new-record-high-in-2021/,Colombia’s cocaine production soared to new record high in 2021
" The director of Colombia’s tax agency DIAN has joined other government officials and politicians calling to legalize cocaine.DIAN director Luis Carlos Reyes said on Twitter that “you have to legalize (and tax) cocaine” in response to The Economist, which also claimed that “it is time to legalize cocaine” in an opinion piece.Reyes joined President Gustavo Petro, who has urged a major shift in global drug policy, which includes the “regulation” instead of prohibition of drugs.“Addiction to money” destroying humanity, Petro tells UNColombia’s Congress is debating a Liberal Party bill that seeks to legalize the cultivation, trade and consumption of marihuana.The initiatives and to legalize drugs can count on fierce support from a minority of conservative and far-right Senators and House Representatives.Public opinion about a possible legalization of drugs is almost evenly divided, according to pollster Invamer.Petro’s refusal to continue fighting the so-called “War on Drugs” surprisingly received the support of the government of US President Joe Biden, who initially said to oppose the legalization of drugs like cocaine.“We support the integral approach of Petro,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken after a meeting with the Colombian president earlier this month.The American government has historically been the main foreign sponsor of repressive drug policies in the South American country.In an attempt to increase diplomatic leverage, Petro has been lobbying support for a radical change in regional drug policies among Latin American governments.Will Colombia combat drug trafficking despite the US?The debate to legalize cocaine gained momentum after the publication of a long-awaited report on the Truth Commission on Colombia’s armed conflict.In its report, the Truth Commission said that counternarcotics policies have largely been responsible for the perpetuation of armed conflict.The Truth Commission additionally said that the illicit drug trade has done tremendous damage to the country’s democracy through the corruption of its State institutions. cocaineDrug policydrug trafficking ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-tax-chief-supports-legalization-of-cocaine/,Colombia’s tax chief supports legalization of cocaine
" Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro is taking a major risk by resuming peace talks with ELN guerrillas in Venezuela.Petro’s peace commissioner Danilo Rueda announced earlier this month that the neighboring country would be one of three guarantor countries of the peace talks.The announcement has been met with skepticism as many doubt whether the authoritarian government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is an appropriate guarantor and host.ELN not just a Colombian problemNegotiations in Caracas (Image: United Nations)The ELN may only be at war with Colombia’s government, but has also become a major public security issue in Venezuela, politicians from that country have stressed.This has been confirmed by independent organizations like the International Crisis Group (ICG) and Human Rights Watch (HRW).According to the ICG and HRW, the ELN has become a major player in the criminal economy in the border region and the neglected jungles in the south of Venezuela.Consequently, “the last thing that the Venezuelan government should be is be a guarantor,” Venezuelan deputy Oscar Ronderos of the Democratic Action party told newspaper El Espectador.Instead, Ronderos proposed that Caracas joined the peace talks as “a party of interest” as “we believe it’s convenient the guerrilla group ceases its violent activities in both Venezuela and Colombia.”The ELN “must talk about what they’re doing in Venezuela,” an anonymous former lawmaker and scholar from the Andes University in the city of Merida told El Espectador.“If they don’t there’s no point in being the guarantor of anything,” the scholar added.Colombia’s ELN rebels a ‘threat to regional stability’: international coalitionHow big is the ELN in Venezuela?The ELN has been active on the border between Colombia and Venezuela for decades, but has increased its control in southern Venezuela over the past few years, according to the ICG.This would have given the ELN major control of illegal gold mining in the jungle region and smuggling routes to Colombia and Guyana.HRW has additionally accused members of Venezuela’s security forces of being complicit in the guerrillas’ human rights abuses in the neighboring country.Maduro has categorically downplayed the guerrillas’ power in Venezuela, but deputy Juan Carlos Palencia from the border state of Tachira claims the ELN has become “a binational guerrilla group.”“So it would be good if they sit down with” the governments of “both nations,” Palencia told El Espectador.The troubled expansion of Colombia’s ELN guerrillasBilateral instabilityELN members going to “guerrilla school” in the border region (Screenshot: ELN)Another complication is that the Petro administration resumed peace talks with the ELN in Caracas before restoring ties with Maduro that were cut in 2019.The two governments agreed to reopen the border last months after which their defense minister met to “begin defining the first steps and a timeline that ultimately leads to the full restoration of military ties between the two countries.”This pending agreement would have a major effect on the ELN and other illegal armed groups that effectively control much of the border between Colombia and Venezuela.Consequently, the possible resumption of a coordinated border security policy could increase pressure on both the Colombian guerrillas and the Venezuelan security forces.Colombia’s failing state | Part 4: The border with Venezuela armed conflictELNELN in Venezuelapeace talkstensions with VenezuelaTotal PeaceVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/why-venezuelas-role-in-colombias-peace-talks-could-become-a-problem/,Why Venezuela’s role in Colombia’s peace talks could become a problem
" Colombia’s Congress approved a bill that allows President Gustavo Petro to negotiate the dismantling of illegal armed groups.The bill gives Petro congressional support for his ambitious “Total Peace” policy, which seeks to reduce violence caused by illegal armed groups and organized crime.According to Interior Minister Alfonso Prado, the approved legislation would allow Colombia to “turn the page” after decades of violence caused by armed conflict and drug trafficking.It is the beginning towards the deepening of democracy, solidarity, inclusion, but above all the beginning to definitively turn the page of the bloodbath in which we are still immersed, the delayed armed conflict we are subjected to, which It should lead us towards total peace, where life is worthy and we can live well, in peace and with dignity.Interior Minister Alfonso PradoAs part of the Total Peace policy, Peace Commissioner Danilo Rueda and guerrilla group ELN resumed peace talks that were suspended by former President Ivan Duque in 2018.Petro and Rueda have additionally invited other illegal armed groups and organized crime groups to negotiate the conditions that would allow them to surrender to justice.According to think tank Indepaz, more than 20 groups have expressed interest in negotiations.Among these groups are the paramilitary organization AGC, and the largest groups formed by dissident former members of the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group.The violence caused by the illegal armed groups is one of the biggest threats to a peace process agreed with the FARC in 2016.The president has vowed to implement the FARC peace deal, which also includes a rural reform and the economic development of Colombia’s countryside, as part of the government’s peace policy.Petro has additionally promised dramatic changes to the government’s drug policy, claiming that this would allow to reduce violence caused by the international cocaine trade. armed conflictorganized crimepeace talksTotal Peace ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-congress-gives-green-light-to-petros-total-peace-policy/,Colombia’s congress gives green light to Petro’s “Total Peace” policy

" Colombia’s prosecution continues to stall investigations into former President Alvaro Uribe’s alleged involvement in crimes against humanity and obstruction of justice.Prosecutor Javier Cardenas asked a Bogota court on Monday to drop fraud and bribery charges pressed by the Supreme Court in 2018.Cardenas is also in charge of an investigation into Uribe’s alleged involvement in multiple homicides in the late 1990’s that hasn’t progressed for two years.Both criminal investigations are related to the alleged ties between the former president’s family and the now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC and ended Uribe’s political career in 2019.Why Colombia’s former president is accused of forming bloodthirsty death squadsThe fraud and bribery chargesProsecutor Javier CardenasCardenas requested a Bogota court to revoke a ruling that rejected a prosecution’s request to drop the fraud and bribery charges earlier this year.The court finds that it is reasonably possible to claim that former Senator Uribe, in the broadest sense, intervened in the activity that is subject to investigation, which implies that it’s impossible to conclude with certainty that… the suspect has nothing to do with it.Bogota courtThe prosecution initially sought to unilaterally drop the charges against Uribe, but this was deemed illegal by another court.The Supreme Court charges could land Uribe in prison and trigger charges related to the former president’s alleged role in the formation of the AUC’s “Bloque Metro” in the late 1990’s.Multiple former members of the Bloque Metro have accused Uribe and his brother Santiago of founding the paramilitary group together with former Medellin Cartel associates.The former president has consistently denied having anything to do with the AUC and the now-defunct cartel from his native Antioquia province.How Colombia’s former president helped kick-start the Medellin CartelThe homicide investigationCardenas isn’t just trying to bury the former president’s alleged fraud and bribery practices, but has omitted to continue an investigation into Uribe’s alleged involvement in crimes against humanity.The Supreme Court started this investigation into Uribe’s alleged role in multiple massacres carried out by the AUC and former Medellin crime lord “Don Berna” in 2018.Uribe resigned from the Senate and renounced from his congressional benefits in 2019, effectively barring the Supreme Court from formally charging the former president with homicide.Uribe’s decision forwarded the criminal investigations to the prosecution, which can’t legally end them without court approval.Cardenas’ failure to effectively investigate Uribe’s alleged role in the paramilitary massacres could get the prosecutor in legal trouble if evidence of obstruction emerges.Uribe tied to yet another massacre, despite extermination of paramilitary group he allegedly founded Alvaro UribeimpunityJavier Fernando Cardenasparapolitics ",https://colombiareports.com/terrorism-related-investigations-against-colombias-former-president-stalled/,Terrorism-related investigations against Colombia’s former president stalled
" Colombia’s prosecution and Comptroller General’s Office are investigating what happened to thousands of assets that apparently went missing after they were seized by law enforcement.The authorities began the investigation after President Gustavo Petro warned that the state-run company that manages seized assets, the Special Assets Society (SAE), could be involved in “one of the worst acts of corruption in history.”The SAE’s newly appointed CEO, Daniel Rojas, confirmed that thousands of assets registered to his firm only exist on paper.Rojas additionally said that the SAE’s inventory of assets lacks information about the condition and estimated market value of real estate in custody of the company.Last but not least, real estate properties in custody of the SAE would be occupied illegally.The alleged chaos spurred Rojas to demand investigations, the SAE chief said last month.The agency was already under fire over the alleged mismanagement of FARC assets surrendered by the former guerrillas following a 2016 peace deal.Colombia’s war crimes tribunal accuses prosecution of not cooperating with transitional justiceFormer SAE chief blames predecessorAndres Avila (Image: Twitter)In a press statement, former SAE CEO Andres Avila said Monday that the discrepancy is due to a database of seized assets the company received from the now-defunct National Narcotics Directorate (DNE) in 2014.Former President Juan Manuel Santos dissolved the DNE after finding that the agency was giving away seized assets to politicians loyal to former President Alvaro Uribe instead of selling them.Former DNE director Carlos Albornoz was sentenced to 19 years in prison last year for turning the DNE into an extremely expensive piñata.Following the dismantling of the DNE, the SAE became the entity in charge of managing assets seized by law enforcement, including those in custody of the dismantled agency.‘Everyone has access to drug agency’s seized assets’The SAE messAccording to Avila, the DNE provided the SAE received an excel sheet with 19,819 real estate properties, 1,700 companies and 12,000 vehicles allegedly in custody of the agency.The former SAE boss said that his company was only able to locate 5,000 of the vehicles in the DNE database.The excel sheet additionally lacked the information that would allow the verification of the real estate properties and firms allegedly in custody of the DNE, said Avila.Avila said nothing about the other alleged irregularities and failed to explain why he never said anything about the fictitious assets until after his successor rang the alarm. corruptionSAE ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-missing-thousands-of-assets-seized-from-organized-crime/,Colombia missing thousands of assets seized from organized crime

" US authorities have registered more than $30 billion in imports from Colombia over the past decade that don’t appear in the South American country’s export statistics.The discrepancy in the trade partners’ statistics is the equivalent of more than 19% of the $157.9 billion in Colombian imported goods reported by the US Census Bureau (USCB) in the past decade.The USCB doesn’t reported imported services, which implies that the discrepancy could be considerably bigger.Discrepancy in reported tradeHow to explain the discrepancy?According to tax agency DIAN, Colombia’s total exports to the US were worth $127.5 billion between 2012 and 2021.This is $30.4 billion less than the imported goods reported by the USCB in the same period.According to the US Trade Representative (USTR), goods made up only 75% of American imports from Colombia in 2019.Including services, American imports from Colombia had a total value of $18.7 billion, the USTR boasts on its website.What doesn’t make sense is that Colombia’s total exports to the US in 2019 were worth a little more than $11.5 billion, according to the DIAN.USTR claims that the import of services from Colombia increased 77% between 2009 and 2019.Gold and cocaineColombia’s tax agency said last month that its customs division had flagged more than 500 companies that were suspected of sending invoices for fictitious goods and services abroad since 2012.A large number of the companies flagged by the DIAN were registered traders in precious metals like gold.Companies accused of exporting fictitious goods and servicesThe list of the DIAN is similar to the so-called “kingpin list” of the US Treasury Department, which bans trade with 370 Colombian businesses suspected of money laundering or financing illegal armed groups.The main difference is that the American list contains considerably less gold companies despite the fact that this metal “is becoming the most important source of financing for illegal armed groups, surpassing even cocaine trafficking,” according to the Department against Transnational Crime of the Organization of American States (OAS).This confirms claims by Interpol and is supported by claims made by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen), which said in November last year that also oil extraction was financing illegal armed groups.There is reporting that in conflict zones, environmental crimes, including illegal exploitation and theft of oil, provide an estimated 38% of illicit income to armed groups, more than any other illicit activity, including drug trafficking.FinCenThe United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime said in June that in Colombia both illegal armed groups (GAO’s) and organized crime groups (GCO’s) were involved in the gold trade and money laundering.This money laundering was made possible through, among other methods, the inflation of invoices of legal gold exports or invoices for fictitious exports, according to a 2021 report by the Global Financial Integrity, which analyzed gold exports between 2010 and 2018.Colombia says that it sold $11.7 billion in gold, but the United States registers that it bought $13.9 billion. The $2.2 billion that doesn’t appear did not enter the Colombian economy but stayed in some financial hideout.Global Financial Integrity investigator Mario ValenciaFurthermore, Colombia is exporting significantly more gold than it is mining, which indicates that illegally mined gold is added to legally mined gold somewhere in the supply chain, according to the OAS’ transnational crime agency.In 2019, Colombia reported gold exports of approximately 10 tons over national gold production that year. In previous years, the discrepancy has been even more pronounced. This suggests the possible large-scale export of illegal gold and the practice of trade-based money laundering through misinvoicing of Colombia’s gold exports. OAS’ Department against Transnational CrimeIn any case, importers from the US and other countries are sending a lot more money to Colombia than their trade partners are actually exporting.The reports by the UN and the OAS focused on the gold trade, which is particularly vulnerable, but money launderers can use any form of international trade for trade-based money laundering.From dollars to pesosBusinesses on the so-called “Kingpin List”The US Treasury Departments said in 2021 that it believed that Colombian transnational crime organizations (TCO’s) received an annual $10 billion for their cocaine sales in the US, mainly through “the Black Market Peso Exchange and trade-based money laundering” with their American associates.The US’ Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) informed the US Congress in 2019 already that America’s legal economy had been infiltrated by money launderers  who were also involved in the gold trade.The US market plays a key role in the global exchange of precious metals. TCO’s use often-witting US businesses to exploit US regulations and export illegally extracted gold to the United States to launder billions of dollars of illicit proceeds from criminal operations in Latin America.FBI assistant deputy director Regina ThompsonIn fact the FBI said that the TCO’s involved in Colombia’s cocaine and gold exports are “threats to US national security and international human rights.” after the US’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) claimed that global “proceeds from illegal mining are estimated by international organizations to be between $12 and $48 billion per year.”The FBI stressed that the agency “remains dedicated to combating this threat” and was “committed to working with… governments in the region” that considered illegal mining “a significant priority.”This is easier said that done as American “prosecutors must demonstrate that the underlying crime is a specified unlawful activity to obtain a money laundering conviction,” law enforcement officials told the US Congress’ Government Accountability Office last year.The alleged involvement of legal mining companies in the illegal mining of gold additionally makes “its origin difficult to trace,” they added.Front companies and notariesFront companies like the ones flagged by the DIAN in Colombia, shell companies in offshore tax havens and the transfer of assets via notary offices further complicate the detection of money laundering rackets.To illustrate, the main Colombian subsidiary of Canadian mining corporation Aris registered his company with a Bogota notary office in 2009 before registering with the Superintendent for Industry and Trade and the DIAN as the subsidiary of a Panamanian company with the same name.Extract of contract indicating Aris Mining’s subsidiary Zandor Capital was founded in a notary office two years before it was formally registered at the Chamber of Commerce.This construction allows shady investors to effectively own a company that is registered in the name of a frontman in Colombia.A flurry of mergers with other mining companies with parents in offshore tax havens and subcontractors that operate their mines made Aris’ empire an opaque network of firms in Latin America and Africa.The Canadian holding’s subsidiaries in Colombia have been accused of ties to crony capitalists and illegal armed groups for more than a decade.CorruptionThe Financial Crimes chief of Colombia’s prosecution, Luz Angela BahamonAnother problems is the fact that many government officials are more interested in the profits of money laundering than national security, human rights or fighting crime.The then-Inspector General of the US’ Department of Justice (DOJ), Michael Horowitz, found in July 2020 that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) had been laundering tens of millions of dollars between 2015 and 2017.Then-DEA Chief Compliance Officer Mary Schaefer assured that “significant progress has been made in recent years and that effort continues today” in a response.In December 2021, however, a DEA agent was sentenced to 12 years in prison for laundering money with a “public official in Colombia” three months after one of his colleagues was sentenced to 13 years after lying to court over his alleged ties to drug traffickers.When my client joined the DEA he was schooled in how to be corrupt, he was schooled in how to break the law.Defense attorney of convicted DEA agent Jose IrizarryIn Colombia, investigations into money laundering associated with the drug trade and gold exports have also been hampered by corruption.The prosecution’s Financial Crimes Chief, Luz Angela Bahamon, is facing multiple corruption charges, including one related to an illegal gold smuggling network.A study released by Colombian financial risk analysis company Infolaft in July revealed that State entities were used to launder money in 21% of the investigated cases.This infiltration of organized crime in government and the global trade has made enforcing the law when it comes to money laundering virtually impossible without shutting down global trade. money launderingorganized crime ",https://colombiareports.com/how-money-laundering-inflates-us-colombia-trade-statistics/,How money laundering inflates US-Colombia trade statistics
" Local authorities in northwest Colombia said that mass migration to Central America has caused a humanitarian crisis on border with Panama.According to the ombudsman of Necocli, his town in the Uraba region has not been able to deal with a growing number of migrants trying to travel to Central America.Necocli ombudsman Wilfredo Menco told local media that the mass migration has become untenable in his town, which officially has 70,000 inhabitants.According to Menco, some 2,500 migrants cross the Gulf of Uraba to the jungles of the so-called Darien Gap on the Panamanian border every day.The number of people stranded in Necocli has grown to more than 10,000 because the number of arriving migrants has outgrown the local transport capacity, said the human rights official.At the moment we have an overcrowding crisis. There are many migrants with specific needs, they are not being given the necessary help and we have many travelers in very precarious conditions, many children with malnutrition problems. We have found children who are poorly cared for because they lack food, shelter, diapers, among other things.Necocli ombudsman Wilfredo MencoThe United States’ Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which coordinates immigration, said Wednesday that more than 3,000 people travel through the Darien Gap every day.The DHS said that the US Government is planning “to offer additional security assistance to support regional partners to address the migration challenges in the Darién Gap.”The European Union’s humanitarian agency said Wednesday that it would increase humanitarian aid for Colombia with $33 million in order to address the crisis in Necocli and Acandi, the municipality on the other side of the Gulf of Uraba.Colombia’s Inspector General’s Office urged the national government to improve coordination with authorities in Panama that would grant all migrants safe passage and reduce the crisis on the border.More than 150,000 people have crossed the Panamanian border through the Darien Gap so far this year, according to Colombia’s national ombudsman’s Office.This would be a major increase compared to the 134,000 people who made this perilous journey in all of 2021.The most recent surge would be due to an increased number of Venezuelans trying to flee their country, which has been suffering a humanitarian and political crisis for more than five years. migrationPanamaVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/humanitarian-crisis-in-northwest-colombia-due-to-mass-migration/,Humanitarian crisis in northwest Colombia due to mass migration

" The government of Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro has proposed a far-reaching and controversial political reform that seeks an “improved representation” of citizens in the government.The proposal presented to Congress lacked promised reforms to electoral authorities that have been been criticized for their lack of independence.Interior Minister Alfonso Prada said Thursday that the government seeks to reform “what is the most urgent and viable to transform politics in Colombia.”In an interview with Colombia Reports, political analyst Esteban Salazar of the think tank Paz y Reconciliacion questioned the viability of the proposal.Lawmakers in governmentSalazar and other political analysts specifically criticized the proposal that would allow a newly elected president to form a cabinet with members of Congress.The integration of elected lawmakers in the formation of a cabinet is normal in parliamentary systems like that of the United Kingdom and other European democracies.In Colombia’s presidential system, however, this would imply a major distortion of the balance of powers enshrined in the constitution, said Salazar.Consequently, the political analyst stressed, the Constitutional Court is likely to sink Petro’s hybrid system if Congress decides to approve the proposal.Reliability of electionsThe government initially said that it would seek to abolish the highly controversial National Electoral Council (CNE) and add an electoral court to the judicial branch.This idea was scrapped after Senators Ariel Avila and Humberto de la Calle proposed two alternative bills to reform Colombia’s election authorities.The CNE’s main problem is that the court validates the election of the very lawmakers who elect the CNE’s magistrates.The electoral tribunal additionally elects the National Registrar, the official in charge of organizing elections.This has caused major controversies over the validity of elections for decades.Prada told press on Thursday that the Petro administration withdrew its proposal reform Colombia’s electoral authorities to “separate the debate” and focus on “the structure of the State.”Notwithstanding, much of Petro’s proposed political reform had everything to do with the organization of elections.Colombia’s elections marred by violence and fraud claimsElectoral corruptionFor example, the government proposed to ban campaign contributions from corporations and private citizens, and allow election candidates to exclusively use State funding.This would severely reduce clientelism, one of Colombia’s most common forms of corruption, according to the government.Elected officials often grant government contracts to their sponsors who in turn use public funds to finance election campaigns, criminal investigations have demonstrated repeatedly.“Corruption cost Colombia’s peace process $119M”Electoral optionsThe government additionally proposed multiple reforms to the election of Congress.Among other things, the Petro administration proposed to lower the minimum age of senate candidates from 30 to 25 years and that of aspiring House representatives from 25 to 18.The government additionally proposed to make the inclusion of women on every other position on political parties’ list of congressional candidates compulsory.Last but not least, the Petro administration wants voters to only choose between political parties by removing the option to vote for individual candidates.The latter would dramatically simplify congressional ballots and reduce the power of regional clans that have historically been most active in vote-buying.The proposal would also end voters’ option to elect congressmen to represent their city or region. election fraudexecutive orderlegislative orderpolitical reform ",https://colombiareports.com/petros-controversial-plans-to-transform-politics-in-colombia/,Petro’s controversial plans to “transform politics in Colombia”
" Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro told the United Nations’ General Assembly that humanity is being threatened by its “addiction to money.”In his first address before the UN’s General Assembly, Petro claimed that both “the war against drugs and the climate crisis have failed” because of unhinged capitalism.“Wars haven’t served but as an excuse not to act against the climate crisis” and “the worst of addictions to power and to oil,” according to the president.The dictates of power have ordered that cocaine is poison and must be persecuted, even if it only causes minimal deaths… but coal and oil on the other hand must be protected, even if their consumption could extinguish all mankind.President Gustavo Petro“You want less drugs? Think less about profits and more about love. Think about the rational use of power,” Petro said in a fierce attack on the world’s current capitalist system.“You will see the jungles and democracies die” for “denying the truth” that “the cause of the disaster” caused by climate change “is capital,” said the president.The logic to come together in order to always consume more, always produce more, and so that a few earn even more is what is causing the climate crisis.President Gustavo Petro“You don’t care about my country,” Petro decried, “unless it’s to poison its jungles, imprison its men and drag its women into exclusion.”The president additionally condemned world leaders’ failure to allocate funds to prevent the Amazon rainforest while allocating funds for ongoing wars.I call on you to integrally save the Amazon rainforest with resources that can be allocated worldwide to life. If you do not have the capacity to finance the fund for the revitalization of the forests, if it is more important to allocate funds to weapons than to life, then reduce the foreign debt to free up our own budgetary spaces and with them carry out the task of saving humanity and life on the planet.President Gustavo PetroThe president invited Latin American leaders at the UN to defend the Americas’ rainforests and rethink drug policy with or without support of “the north.” climate changeDrug policyforeign relationsGustavo PetroPanamaUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/addiction-to-money-destroying-humanity-petro-tells-un/,"“Addiction to money” destroying humanity, Petro tells UN"

" Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro has made it clear that his government will combat drug trafficking with or without the government of the United States.In his speech before the United Nations’ General assembly on Tuesday, Petro didn’t just fiercely condemn Washington DC’s counternarcotics policy in Latin America, but the mass incarceration of African Americans in the US.If we do not correct course and this goes on for another 40 years, the United States will see 2,800,000 young people die of overdoses from fentanyl, which is not produced in our Latin America. It will see millions of African Americans imprisoned in its private jails.

" Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro said his regime accepted a request to resume its role as guarantor of peace talks between Colombia’s government guerrilla group ELN.According to local media Colombian President Gustavo Petro had requested Caracas’ renewed support for the peace talks that were suspended in 2018, according to local media.In a television address, Venezuela’s strongman said Tuesday that he accepted the request.To President Gustavo Petro and to Colombia we say: Venezuela accepts the role of guarantor of the negotiations and peace agreements of Colombia with the ELN.Venezuelan President Nicolas MaduroThe Maduro regime was one of the guarantors of formal peace talks between former President Juan Manuel Santos and the ELN after they began in 2017.Former President Ivan Duque suspended the talks and even accused the Maduro administration of having ties with the guerrillas after taking office in 2018.Petro has been trying to resume Santos’ negotiations with the guerrillas since taking office last month.Peace talks with Colombia’s ELN guerrillas ‘about to be resumed’: PetroWhy Venezuela’s involvement in controversialWhile there exists no evidence of ties between the authoritarian Maduro regime and the guerrillas, evidence that the ELN is highly active in Venezuela is mounting.In fact, evidence indicates that the guerrillas use their illegal economic activity in Venezuela’s southern jungles to fund their guerrilla armies in Colombia.Venezuela’s security forces have largely ignored the ELN because the guerrillas haven’t challenged Maduro’s authority, unlike the political opposition in cities in the north.The possible participation of the ELN in a peace process in Colombia could have major implications for Venezuela.The demobilization of the relatively cooperative guerrillas may require the presence of security forces in the south of the country, which could weaken Maduro’s repression of political opposition.Almost half of ELN’s forces are in Venezuela, Colombia’s military claimsWhy wasn’t Venezuela as much of a problem before?The ELN’s explosive growth since 2017 had made a possible role for Venezuela significantly more complicated.This is partly due to Maduro’s failure to combat the guerrillas’ power in Venezuela, Duque’s disastrous attempts to do the opposite in Colombia and the suspension of ties between the two neighbors in 2019.This allowed the ELN to expand its economic activities in southern Venezuela and its military presence along the border between the two countries.Colombia’s failing state | Part 4: The border with Venezuela armed conflictELNNicolas Maduropeace talksVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/venezuela-to-resume-role-as-guarantor-of-colombias-peace-talks-with-eln/,Venezuela to resume role as guarantor of Colombia’s peace talks with ELN
" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal JEP announced an investigation into crimes against humanity committed against ethnic minorities.The investigation would seek justice for war crimes that left more than 1.35 million victims who belong to ethnic minorities, JEP president Eduardo Cifuentes said Tuesday.The crimes that will be investigated were committed by state officials, the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and civilians.The investigation is the ninth since the JEP took force in 2018.JEP investigationsFARC kidnappingsCrimes committed in NariñoExtrajudicial executions by the security forcesCrimes committed in UrabaCrimes committed in northern Cauca and the south of Valle del CaucaExtermination of the Patriotic Union partyChild recruitmentState crimes with support from the private sectorCrimes against ethnic minoritiesIn a press statement, the JEP said that the ethnic minority case will follow three lines of investigation.The first investigation will look into crimes that were committed by the FARC as a consequence of the guerrillas’ strategy to fight its insurgency from regions where indigenous peoples and Afro Colombian communities enjoy autonomy.The second investigation will look into crimes that were committed because of the “counterinsurgent discrimination” of ethnic minorities by the security forces and their associates in the private sector.The last investigation will focus on crimes committed by both the FARC and the security forces as they tried to assume territorial control as part of the armed conflict.Ethnic minorities have disproportionately been affected by the armed conflict in their country because of a combination of factors that include the location of their territories and racism.Multiple indigenous peoples have faced extinction because of violence associated with the armed conflict, the Constitutional Court found years ago.The JEP’s criminal investigation is the result of a peace deal between former President Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC, which found that ethnic minorities “have suffered histories of injustice as a result of colonization, slavery, exclusion and the dispossession of their lands, territories and resources.”Crimes committed by paramilitary groups are being investigated by another transitional justice system, Justice and Peace, which took force after the partial demobilization of paramilitary organization AUC between 2003 and 2006.The government of President Gustavo Petro is trying to resume peace talks with guerrilla group ELN that include criminal investigations into war crimes committed by that guerrilla group.

" Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro announced on Friday that the gradual reopening of the border with Venezuela will begin on September 26.The gradual reopening of the border is part of a bilateral effort to reestablish ties that were cut by Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro in 2019.Petro said on social media platform Twitter that the two governments agreed to resume flights and cargo transports between the neighboring countries “as a first step.”The president did not specify when land border crossings will be opened for citizens of the neighboring countries.Gradual restoration of tiesThe gradual reopening of the borders comes weeks after Petro and Maduro reopened the two countries’ embassies in Bogota and Caracas.Following the reopening of cargo transport and air travel, the governments have yet to coordinate the full reopening of land border crossings.This step is delicate because of a migration crisis caused by an unprecedented flow of Venezuelans leaving their country that began in 2014.According to the United Nations, more than 5.6 million Venezuelans have left their countries to escape deplorable conditions in their country.An estimated 2.5 million of these migrants have settled in Colombia, according to the country’s migration agency.How to keep Venezuela’s diaspora in Colombia safe?Border economy and securityThe rupture of ties between Colombia and Venezuela, combined with the mass migration, plunged the border region in a major crisis.The closing of the border devastated the economy in the border region, which was largely dependent on trade between the two countries.The suspension of cooperation between the two countries’ security forces additionally surged violence in the region that was overtaken by illegal armed groups.Colombia’s failing state | Part 4: The border with VenezuelaWhy the border was closedThe Venezuelan government broke off ties with its Colombian counterpart in response to a failed opposition plot to oust Maduro.This plot included an attempt to move trucks with “humanitarian aid” of the US government from from the Colombian border city of Cucuta into Venezuela.The operation turned violent after which Caracas closed the borders and broke off ties with the governments of Colombia and the US. crisis with Venezuelaforeign relationsVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-announces-reopening-of-border-with-venezuela/,Colombia announces reopening of border with Venezuela

" Colombia’s Caribbean port city Cartagena has seen a surge in assassinations this year as paramilitary organization AGC is struggling to maintain control over local gangs.More than 75 people have been assassinated in Cartagena so far this year, a significant increase in gang violence in the port city where “sicarios” killed 52 people in 2021.The total number of homicides climbed to 238 on Wednesday after a two-year-old boy was killed by a stray bullet.According to Cartagena’s police chief, General Nicolas Zapata, the gang violence is caused by fighting between AGC forces “from other parts of the country” and its “people from the region.”The AGC and Cartagena’s gangsAn estimated 36 gangs control Cartagena’s organized crime rackets and the drug trafficking routes to the container terminal in the south of the port city.The AGC’s “Caribbean Heroes” front controls the north of the Bolivar province and the routes that connect inland cocaine production facilities to Cartagena.Some of the coastal city’s gangs apparently stopped taking orders from the paramilitaries after the arrest of the Caribbean Heroes’ alleged commander, “Falcon,” in the Antioquia province last year.In March, assassins of “the real AGC” left a pamphlet on the body of one of their victims, warning that “this will happen to Pati Pati and Jose Abogado’s gangs.”According to Cartagena’s police chief, “Pati Pati” and “Jose Abogado” are coordinating the AGC’s offensive in Cartagena from their Antioquia hideouts.This faction would be opposed by gangs that follow orders from alleged AGC ringleaders who are imprisoned in Cartagena’s Ternera prison and the Combita maximum security prison in Boyaca.The wars for Colombia’s cocaine containers | Part 2: BarranquillaAuthorities swimming against the currentGeneral Nicolas Zapata (Image: National Police)Authorities, and the Cartagena Police Department in particular, have been overwhelmed by the surge in gang violence and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Local police arrested more than 2,240 people so far this year, but failed to prevent the 38 homicides that made August the deadliest month of 2022.Zapata asked the National Police to reinforce the Cartagena police force, which currently consists of 2,958 cops.Public Security Secretary Ana Maria Gonzalez said that Cartagena’s city hall would additionally step up social programs that are “more constructive and preventive” and would “allow crime to be deterred.”Tensions between the AGC and rival groups involved in drug trafficking have surged violence in multiple port cities on Colombia’s Caribbean coast.The wars for Colombia’s cocaine containers | Part 3: Santa Marta BolivarCartagenadrug trafficking ",https://colombiareports.com/the-wars-for-colombias-cocaine-containers-part-4-cartagena/,The wars for Colombia’s cocaine containers | Part 4: Cartagena
" A court slammed Colombia’s prosecution and US prison authorities for frustrating investigations into war crimes of former paramilitary bosses who were extradited on drug trafficking charges.Medellin’s Superior Tribunal criticized the American and Colombian authorities in a ruling that upheld judicial benefits of “Don Berna,” the heir of late drug lord Pablo Escobar.According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, Berna has refused to take part in virtual court hearings since February last year.Berna’s defense attorney claimed that the founder of paramilitary organization AUC hasn’t been able to attend the hearings because the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) failed to facilitate them.Don Berna’s surprise transfer“Don Berna” (Screenshot: Medellin Superior Tribunal)The court said that it was set to issue a verdict about Berna’s alleged involvement in 445 crimes against humanity that left 1764 victims in August last year.The BOP moved Berna out of the health facility of the Miami prison from where the extradited AUC chief had been cooperating with Colombian justice for more than 10 years in June, however.Berna’s lawyers didn’t know their client had been transferred to the Terre Haute maximum security prison in Indiana until a Miami inmate alerted them about the transfer, the court confirmed.Neither his family nor his attorney were notified about the transfer. He was simply transferred and — as the defense tells it — she came to know about it because another inmate told the paralegal, who in turn told the defendant’s defense counsel, who immediately informed the prosecution.Medellin Superior TribunalThe court found out in September last year that the hearings that were planned on Fridays were impossible because the Terre Haute prison would only allow virtual hearings on Monday.The Indiana prison murdersThe maximum security prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. (Image: Federal Bureau of Prisons)Berna subsequently requested to postpone the hearings until 2022, claiming that his removal from the hospital ward had deteriorated his health and that he feared for his safety in Indiana.The prosecution downplayed Berna’s alleged fears about other inmates’ hostility towards “snitches,” claiming that other extradited former paramilitary commanders never complained about this.The Associated Press reported in September last year that the murders raised “fresh questions about the government’s ability to keep prisoners safe.”The US Department of Justice (DOJ) wrote prosecutor Tatiana Garcia of Prosecutor General’s Office’s international affair desk in May that the BOP was “willing to guarantee” Berna’s “personal safety in the face of his participation in these hearings.”The DOJ added, however that “in any case, the Colombian state… is the guarantor of Murillo’s integrity… and can adopt any measure for the security of this prisoner in the United States.”The court dismissed the prosecution’s claims that no other former AUC chief complained about security as “none of them have been in the same prison, which has a death row and where there wasn’t even a place for video conferences.”The court additionally contradicted the DOJ, claiming that the US Government “enjoys full autonomy when it comes to penitentiary issues.”Berna’s security fears effectively constitute “an excessive burden that may not be imposed” while on trial, the court said.Previous problems to investigate war crimesThe court said that the problems that followed Berna’s surprise transfer were the latest in a series that have complicated investigations into war crimes committed by the AUC.The court blasted the decision of former President Alvaro Uribe to extradite Berna and other former paramilitary commanders without court approval in 2008.The investigations were additionally complicated by the fact that the extradited paramilitary commanders couldn’t provide Colombian authorities with information that could be used against them in pending drug trafficking trials in the US.Last but not least, the court said that some extradited former AUC chiefs ended their cooperation with justice in Colombia after US authorities reduced their sentences and granted them visas.Extradition in itself is not necessarily an obstacle to learning the truth and obtaining justice and reparations, but in many cases has constituted an additional inconvenience exactly due to the internal regulations of the United States and its prisons, and to the additional difficulties for the reconstruction of the truth presented by removing the perpetrators from contact with other members of the armed group, removing from the context in which they committed the crimes and exposing to particular and indeterminate situations while they serve their sentences in a country that prioritizes its interests related to narcotics trafficking and not to the interests of thousands of victims in this country who have been waiting decades for truth, justice and reparations.Medellin Superior TribunalEarly release of extradited drug traffickers ‘insulting’: Colombian senatorBerna’s victims and alleged former allies waiting for decadesAccording to the court, more than 5,000 people became the victim of Berna after the former Medellin Cartel enforcer teamed up with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the National Police and other narcos in the early 1990’s.The counternarcotics agents’ alliance with the drug traffickers allowed former US President Bill Clinton to congratulate his Colombian counterpart Cesar Gaviria for killing late drug lord Pablo Escobar in 1993.I want to offer my congratulations to you and the Colombian security forces for your courageous and effective work in this case. Hundreds of Colombians, brave police officers and innocent people, lost their lives as a result of Escobar’s terrorism. Your work honors the memory of all of these victims. We are proud of the firm stand you have taken, and I pledge to you our continued cooperation in our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking.Former President Bill ClintonEscobar’s death allowed Berna to take over the Medellin Cartel’s enforcer army and incorporate “La Oficina de Envigado” into paramilitary organization AUC in 1997.The Medellin crime lord increased cocaine exports to the United States to finance the AUC, which embarked on a terrorism campaign together with Colombia’s security forces.While Berna’s drug trafficking activities helped finance the AUC, Clinton agreed to help Colombia’s security forces with billions of dollars.The extreme violence spurred the government of former US President George W. Bush to declare the AUC a foreign terrorist organization in 2001.In an attempt to force Berna and his paramilitary allies to demobilize, the DEA turned against their former ally and helped the DOJ indict the Medellin crime lord on drug trafficking charges in 2004.Berna agreed to surrender to justice in 2005, but continued to run “La Oficina” with his lieutenant “Rogelio” until former President Alvaro Uribe surprisingly extradited the AUC’s former leadership in 2008.A US court sentenced Berna to 31 years in prison in 2009 and the former AUC chief reluctantly began cooperating with Colombian justice.La Oficina’s powerful former alliesFormer US Drug car William Brownfield (Sceenshot: Wilson Center)Former DEA agent David Tinsley helped Rogelio barter a deal with the DOJ in 2008 that allowed Berna’s successor to retire in Florida after spending seven years in a US prison.The US Government refused to give visas to Berna’s family members in 2009 after they began receiving death threats in response to Berna’s testimony about his alleged ties to the former commander of the National Army, General Mario Monrtoya.Earlier that year, then-US Ambassador to Colombia William Brownfield teamed up with Escobar’s cousin, Jose Obdulio Gaviria, to cover up their ties to Berna and La Oficina.Brownfield knew Gaviria was “using paramilitaries in Medellin” to discredit a Supreme Court investigation into ties between Uribe’s cousin Mario and Medellin drug traffickers since 2008 because he had been told so by General Oscar Naranjo, the director of the National Police at the time.Former Senator Rodrigo Lara additionally warned the ambassador that “a much more subtle Medellin Cartel is the true ‘power behind the throne’ of the Uribe administration” in 2009.Mounting evidence indicated that Naranjo and Lara were right, but Brownfield told the US State Department that Lara’s claims were “far-fetched.”The cover-ups worked as Bush awarded Uribe a “Medal of Freedom” in 2010 and put Brownfield in charge of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in 2011.As the US’ drug czar, Brownfield failed to prevent the extradition of two of Uribe’s former presidential security chiefs and former peace commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo for their ties to Berna in 2012 and 2014, or the escalating opioid crisis in the US.Despite mounting evidence of his alleged ties to La Oficina, Brownfield remained in office at the INL until 2018 after which he joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Wilson Center.

" Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro traveled to the southern Neiva province after armed men massacred seven policemen.The deadly attack on the police convoy took place just outside the provincial capital Neiva on Friday.According to the National Police, the cops came under fire and were attacked with explosives while on patrol.The responsibility of the attack wasn’t immediately claimed by any of the illegal armed groups that are active in the region.Petro traveled to Neiva after sending Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez, Interior Minister Alfonso Prada and General Henry Armando Sanabria of the National Police to lead the investigations into the attack.The commander of the Armed Forces, General Helder Fernan Giraldo, traveled to Neiva to coordinate attempts to reinforce security in the region.The president ordered the government and police officials to create a “Joint-Command Post” in Neiva that would improve regional security coordination.According to Petro, the attack was an “evident sabotage of Total Peace,” the government’s policy that seeks to expand a peace process that began with a 2016 agreement with the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.Multiple illegal armed groups have expressed their interest in taking part in the government’s proposed peace process.None of the groups have made visible efforts to reduce violence against the security forces and civilians.   armed conflictHuilaNational Police ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-mourns-massacre-of-7-police/,Colombia mourns massacre of 7 police
" The “Total Peace” policy proposal of President Gustavo Petro appears to confusing Colombia’s illegal armed groups.In a press statement, guerrilla group ELN said that the government’s “Humane Security and Total Peace” proposal was causing confusion, which it is.Petro’s “Total Peace” proposal seeks to implement a 2016 peace deal with the now defunct guerrilla group FARC, resume peace talks with the ELN and negotiate the demobilization of so-called “Organized Armed Groups (GAO’s) like paramilitary organization AGC.Foreign Minister Alvaro Leyva opened negotiations with the government of American President Joe Biden to shield alleged drug traffickers from extradition to the US.Peace talks with the mafia?ELN guerrilla (Screenshot: YouTube)The government’s initiatives apparently gave mafia bosses the impression that they would receive judicial benefits if they dismantled their organized crime groups, also known as GDO’s.In a letter to Petro, a coalition of GDO’s and jailed former paramilitary commanders said they wanted to take part in the “Total Peace” process early last month.According to the ELN, “qualifying organized crime groups… with ties to the elites’ interests as if they were opposition organizations” would “grant impunity and benefits to the major capos tied to powerful economic and political sectors, and the military.”The AGC had already distanced itself from the GDO’s and the jailed former AUC bosses while reiterating their willingness to resume negotiation about their possible demobilization and disarmament.The confusion appears to be due to the fact that neither Petro nor Interior Minister Alfonso Prada ever clarified whether or not the “Total Peace” proposal included organized crime.Petro proposes multilateral ceasefire with Colombia’s illegal armed groupsInternational Humanitarian LawAGC fighters (Image: AGC)Prada’s bill specified that the negotiations would be with groups that fit the description of an organized armed group as specified by International Humanitarian Law (IHL). In line with International Humanitarian Law, an outlawed organized armed group is one that, under the leadership of a responsible command, exercises territorial control that allows it to carry out sustained and coordinated military operations.”Humane Security and Total Peace billWhat apparently confused the ELN is that IHL doesn’t take into account whether an illegal armed group has a political agenda or not.The organized crime groups apparently believed they could take part in Petro’s “Total Peace” process despite the fact that they aren’t considered GAO’s by international law.The government has failed to rule out the participation of GDO’s in the “Total Peace” process through, for example, a more lenient interpretation of international law.How Colombia’s gold finances illegal armed groupsThe GDO threatMembers of Medellin crime syndicate “La Oficina de Envigado”The ELN, and GAO’s like the AGC and FARC dissident groups are held responsible for most of the violence in Colombia’s countryside.The GDO’s, on the other hand, are mainly held responsible for the violence in Colombia’s cities, where gangs are in control particularly in poor neighborhoods.Medellin authorities estimate that local crime syndicate “La Oficina de Envigado,” has approximately 2,500 members in their city alone.La Oficina, and GDO’s like “Los Pachenca” from Santa Marta and “La Cordillera” from Pereira, have never shown an interest in politics like the ELN and are barely active outside their cities.Their combined firepower makes them a major public security threat in Colombia’s cities, which could sabotage any attempt to achieve “Total Peace” in the country, especially if the GDO’s decide to join forces like the collection of paramilitary groups that formed the AGC. armed conflictpeace processpublic securityTotal Peace ",https://colombiareports.com/confusion-in-colombia-over-petros-total-peace-plans/,Confusion in Colombia over Petro’s “Total Peace” plans
" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal JEP announced investigations into war crimes committed by state officials, and their allies in the private sector and paramilitary groups.In a press conference, JEP magistrate Belkis Izquierdo said that “Case 08” is the first that investigates a specific group of suspected war criminals.The case involves war crimes committed by security and government officials “either in association with paramilitary groups or third parties,” said Izquierdo.The lines of investigationsCounterinsurgency “Crimes that are related to motives described by the prosecution as the ‘radicalization of the counterinsurgency struggle and the stigmatization of the civilian population’. Behind these motivations was also the intention to consolidate territorial control through the victimization of civilians suspected of belonging to or collaborating with the FARC-EP, ELN and EPL guerrillas.”Para-economics “Crimes that are motivated by the control of the economic interests of the territory, its riches and the land grabbing of rural inhabitants. An important part of the crimes related to the counterinsurgency were functional to the economic interests of legal and illegal actors, by creating the conditions for the extraction of natural resources, the expansion of the agricultural frontier and the incorporation of new lands into the market.”Parapolitics Crimes that “sought to obtain funds from the state administration to strengthen the strategy of expansion and regional and national consolidation of paramilitary structures, but also the possibility of expanding their social bases by controlling the supply of bureaucratic, electoral or public contracting services. The paramilitaries relied on members of the security forces, other state agents and civilian third parties as their intermediaries in the capture of the public function and apparatus.”According to preliminary information provided by the JEP’s Investigation Unit, the crimes investigated under Case 08 were primarily carried out by paramilitary groups and left more than 71,000 victims.More than half of these crimes were committed between 2000 and 2009.Izquierdo said that 2,840 suspects in the case have already submitted to the JEP. These suspects may receive judicial benefits if they cooperate with the transitional justice system.The ordinary justice system will be ordered to investigate all alleged war criminals mentioned in Case 08 or any of the JEP’s investigations.Izquierdo said that the JEP will join forces with “Justice and Peace,” the transitional justice system that has been investigating former members of the now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC since 2005.The investigation will prioritize regions where the crimes that fall under Case 08 were particularly common in an attempt to administer justice more efficiently. armed conflictJEPpara-economicsparapoliticspeace processWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-war-crimes-tribunal-to-investigate-state-officials-business-associates/,Colombia’s war crimes tribunal to investigate state officials’ business associates
" American food giant Chiquita Brands will face trial for financing terrorism in Colombia in the 1990’s and early 2000’s, according to victim representatives.In a press statement, human rights NGO EarthRights International said that an appeals court overruled a federal judge who ruled in 2019 that victims of the now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC lacked admissible evidence to sue Chiquita.EarthRights International represents hundreds of people whose family members were assassinated by the AUC and are seeking damages from the paramilitaries’ corporate sponsor.Colombia charges 13 former Chiquita executives over hundreds of murdersChiquita’s admitted terrorism activityChiquita admitted that it had paid the paramilitary organization $1.7 million through its Colombian subsidiary Banadex between 1997 and 2004 in a 2007 plea bargain with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).In this plea bargain, the American company’s chief executives said that they knew about Banadex’s contributions to the paramilitaries in the Uraba region and the city of Santa Marta since before September 2000.Around that time, the AUC wasn’t just receiving monthly payments from the Chiquita subsidiary, but using its port in Uraba for the illegal import of arms.The payments and the arms trafficking continued after the US State Department designated the AUC a foreign terrorist organization in September 2001.Chiquita loses suit to prevent release of AUC recordsFrom Colombia’s plantations to US courtsAfter admitting to sponsoring a designated terrorist organization, Chiquita began fighting the families of its victims’ in court to avoid paying compensation.Today’s order was a milestone in this historic lawsuit. The families have been waiting years to have their day in court despite strenuous efforts by Chiquita to have the case dismissed. Now that the appellate court has reinstated the case, the families are looking forward to a jury trial.EarthRights General Counsel Marco SimonsAccording to victims representatives, the AUC assassinated and forcibly disappeared thousands of people to protect the financial interests of their sponsors in Colombia.Former commanders of the AUC, which partially demobilized between 2003 and 2006, testified that Chiquita was one of many banana companies that sponsored the paramilitary organization.The banana exporters’ sponsorship “operationally strengthened the paramilitary group to carry out human rights violations against the rural population” in the banana growing regions, the Truth Commission said in its report on the armed conflict that was presented earlier this year.According to the Truth Commission, the paramilitaries were responsible for assassinating more than 200,000 civilians during the armed conflict.War crimes tribunal JEP announced last month that it would begin an investigation into the involvement of businesses and politicians in crimes against humanity that were committed during the war.Colombia’s war crimes tribunal to investigate state officials’ business associates armed conflictAUCChiquitapara-economicsparamilitariesterrorismUnited Stateswar victims ",https://colombiareports.com/chiquita-to-trial-for-financing-terrorism-in-colombia/,Chiquita to trial for financing terrorism in Colombia

" Colombia’s police suspended forcibly eradicating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine.The historic decision was announced by the director of the National Police, director General Henry Sanabria.Authorities ended the aerial fumigation of coca because of the effects of public health and the environment in 2015.In an interview with newspaper El Tiempo, Sanabria added that the counternarcotics unit was ordered to inform environmental authorities that police would not seek a resumption of aerial spraying.According to Sanabria, the decision seeks to “guarantee that those who are least involved in the drug trade aren’t affected” by counternarcotics.President Gustavo Petro, an outspoken critic of the so-called War on Drugs, previously ordered police to focus their attention on known drug trafficking hubs like seaports and certain land border regions.The president has also vowed to resume the implementation of a 2016 peace deal, which seeks to reduce the production of cocaine with crop substitution programs for coca farmers.The forced eradication and the aerial spraying of coca have been controversial counternarcotics strategies for decades because of their apparent lack of effectiveness.Coca cultivation and eradicationAccording to the Defense Ministry, the security forces forcibly eradicated 336,585 hectares of coca between 2017 and 2020, but were only able to reduce the number of hectares used for coca cultivation by 28,000 hectares.This is due to the fact that most coca farmers immediately replant their coca, which can be harvested multiple times a year, immediately after police eradication.The militarized strategy of former President Ivan Duque was fiercely criticized because of its lack of effectiveness and the high cost when it came to killed policemen.The police announcement to suspended the forced eradication of coca comes before Petro presented any policy proposal that would involve counternarcotics to Congress.The president has consistently claimed that he would try to implement a “Total Peace” policy, which would include the dismantling of the illegal armed groups that are more active in the drug trade. coca cultivationdrug traffickingforced eradicationNational Police ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-suspends-forced-eradication-of-coca/,Colombia suspends forced eradication of coca

" Almost half of Colombia’s war victims live in poverty due to persistent State failures to help them rebuild their lives, according to the government accountability office.The Comptroller General’s Office said Monday that the government would need to allocate more than $68 billion before 2031 and make “the required institutional reforms to effectively offer effective attention and reparation” to victims.According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, more than 8.8 million victims continue to wait for the aid they were promised by the so-called Victims and Land Restitution Law in 2011.Only 12% of the more than 9 million registered victims effectively received financial aid over the past decade, said the Prosecutor General’s Office.Among ethnic minorities, only 9% of war victims received the aid they were promised.Of the more than 4.5 million women who needed psychological support to deal with war traumas, only 107,000 effectively received saw a social worker or a psychologist, according to the Prosecutor General’s Office.President Gustavo Petro claimed that “it would take almost a century to repair the current victims” if the government would continue the policies of his predecessors.Petro blasted his predecessors as he swore his director of the National Victims Unit (UNV), which is supposed to coordinate the attention to victims.There has been no desire to make peace in Colombia because they found a way to govern though violence and the concentration of wealth through violence.President Gustavo PetroThe new UNV director, Patricia Tobon, said that it was “ridiculous” that only 16 of the more than 400 collective reparation processes that were promised over the past decade were effectively executed.According to the congressional commission that monitors government compliance with the victims law, former President Ivan Duque made the situation for victims even worse by lowering the UNV’s victims reparation budget.Allegedly criminal former President Alvaro Uribe, Duque’s political patron, has consistently opposed the Victims Law, claiming that victims support was “too expensive.”The refusal of Petro’s predecessor to implement a peace process that followed a 2016 peace deal with the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC further increased the number of war victims over the past few years. armed conflictNational Victims Unitvictim reparationvictims ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-needs-68b-before-2031-to-help-war-victims-rebuild-lives/,Colombia needs $68B before 2031 for war victims to rebuild lives
" President Gustavo Petro has rejected his predecessor’s disastrous response to a security crisis in Colombia, but can’t immediately implement his own.Since the president took office earlier this month, hundred of people have been forcibly displaced as a consequence of violence between illegal armed groups and against civilians.Two massacres were added to the 61 that were registered by conflict monitoring NGO Indepaz in the little more than seven months that former President Ivan Duque was in office.The same NGO also registered the assassinations of 114 human rights defenders and community leaders so far this year.Massacre victims so far this yearMore than 70,000 people were forcibly displaced because of violence in the first half of 2022, according to the International Commission of the Red Cross.According to the United Nations’ humanitarian agency, violence and armed conflict has affected the lives of more than 3 million Colombians so far this year compared to 150,000 in the same period in 2021.Colombia subjected to worst levels of violence in decadesTotal peaceRelative order in the Senate (Image: Senate)While on campaign, Petro promised he would abandon the “Peace with Legality” security policy of his predecessor Ivan Duque an implement his ambitious “Total Peace” policy instead.This policy proposal wants to tackle Colombia’s rapidly deteriorating security situation through far-reaching reforms in the security forces, a new drug policy and a peace policy that includes dismantling the illegal armed groups that are wreaking havoc in the countryside.The problem is that Petro won’t be able to implement any of these policy without congressional approval, which last week needed three hours just to formally begin one of its sessions.Additionally, whether all the government coalition parties will support all of Petro’s Total Peace plans is nothing but certain.Meanwhile, the president is forced to come up with provisional

president has been seeking provisional strategy changes.Over the past week, the president ordered the security forces prevent massacres that have skyrocketed since 2020 “as much as possible.”Petro warned army and police on Twitter that “massacres and their impunity in their jurisdiction will affect commanders’ resumes” without providing specifics.The president presumably wants the army and

trafficking instead of waging a war against them.The government has yet to present a policy proposal to Congress, however.Petro and Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez have told the new military leadership that they want counternarcotics agents to increase their presence at ports and land borders to stop cocaine from leaving the country.Historically, these counternarcotics units mainly

" Colombia’s transport ministry suspended a $740 million project that sought to upgrade a canal that has been an engineering nightmare for more than five centuries.The suspension is the latest victory for the people that live in the vicinity of the 115-kilometer Levee Canal (Canal del Dique), which connects the Magdalena River with the port city of Cartagena.A questionable bidding processFormer President Ivan Duque did “everything humanly possible” to give Spanish multinational Sacyr $740 for the “Restauration of the Levee Canal’s Degraded Ecosystems” before leaving office on Friday.Duque called the suspended project was “the most important in Colombia of this century” on a visit to Cartagena in April.Former Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez said the project would “give us the opportunity to have another exit point of Colombia’s export products.”What we are interested in is to leave this Levee Canal advanced and finished as the most emblematic project in the fight against climate change in this country.President Ivan DuqueThe president and his former VP at the time said that 20 companies were interested in the canal project.Last week, only construction company Sacyr, which is the subject of a corruption investigation in Spain, had made a bid.The Comptroller General’s Office subsequently found inconsistencies between the company’s project proposal and the evaluation of this proposal by the National Infrastructure Agency (ANI).Environment minister Susana Muhamad additionally said that the former government ignored a 2017 order to conduct a study on the environmental impact of the project before allowing companies to bid.Despite everything, ANI director Manuel Felipe Gutierrez tried to close the deal hours before the end of his term on Friday.Gutierrez was forced to leave the project in the hands of the government of President Gustavo Petro after the press got wind of his controversial plans.Curiously, the ANI gave the Spanish company $920 million to upgrade the highway that connects the Pacific port city Buenaventura with the rest of Colombia in a last-minute deal instead.Transport Minister Guillermo Reyes suspended the Levee Canal project for at least a month immediately after taking office on Thursday, claiming that “awarding a process that has questions would be irresponsible.”A cemetery made of waterLocals take part in a ceremony in the Leveee Vanal to commemorate local victims of Colombia’s armed conflict (Image: Truth Commission)The suspension came two days after war crimes tribunal JEP ordered the ANI and whoever gets the Levee Canal contract to guarantee the search, exhumation, identification and the dignified return of human remains in the canal and the surrounding wetlands.According to the JEP, paramilitary groups disappeared between 6,765 and 9,638 people in the area around the canal between 1991 and 2015.Today we have a reality and a dream, not just for the people of Cartagena but of all Colombia because the story of the Canal del Dique in the end is the story of our country.Former ANI construction executive Diana Cardona“The testimonies of the communities indicate that the waters around this river became a cemetery” where paramilitaries assassinated, disappeared and/or dismembers almost “10,000 people,” locals told Leyner Palacios, who has investigated the violence in the canal area for the Truth Commission since 2018.According to the commission that has investigated the armed conflict, the paramilitary terror surged in 1997 when authorities proposed the suspended project and the now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC created the “Canal del Dique Front.”For more than 7 years, the practice of killing between 8 and 10 people a day was normal. Sometimes this number could be higher even.Truth Commissioner Leyner PalaciosThe group’s former commander, “Juancho Dique,” told the Truth Commission that the paramilitaries dumped their victims  in the Levee Canal because local authorities wanted to lower “the crime statistics’ and make sure that “nobody would find out about the homicides.”Locals couldn’t ignore the terror. In fact, they couldn’t even come near the canal because “the smell of decomposing corpses was very strong,” according to Palacios.The paramilitary group that was formed by the local elite and the security forces demobilized in 2005 and the “Restauration of the Levee Canal’s Degraded Ecosystems” project was put on hold.“Juancho Dique” takes part in a reconciliation event with some of his victims. (Image: Truth Commission)Dique has actively been trying to help his victims overcome the paramilitary terror, but told newspaper El Espectador that he is too afraid to reveal who sponsored his group.It’s more dangerous to talk about the political system than the security forces because they have a lot of power. They are alive, they stay the same and they are very dangerous.“Juancho Dique”Additionally, the Levee Canal “is an illegal trafficking route, more than anything of weapons and drugs,” according to a social leader from the region.According to Manati Mayor Evaristo Oliveros, illegal armed groups are also using the canal for illegal fuel transports.“What they can’t sell they dump in the Levee Canal, the mayor said in June.How much the canal contributes to Colombia’s legal economy is unclear.From disaster to disasterThe government of former President Juan Manuel Santos revived the “Restauration of the Levee Canal’s Degraded Ecosystems” project in 2013 after a disaster that left more than 100,000 victims.In November 2010, the northern levee of the Canal del Dique broke and much of the Atlantico province was flooded.The 2010 flood was the latest of a series of disasters that began in 1575 when Spanish colonists realized that Cartagena, one of their main ports in South America, was 115 kilometers away from the Magdalena River.The Magdalena is like the Mississippi of South America’s Caribbean coast and connects Spain to its colonial settlements in what is now Colombia.For some reason, conquistador Pedro de Heredia visited the mouth of the Magdalena River in early 1533, but decided a weeks later to found Cartagena 115 kilometers southwest of what would be a perfect port instead.The Spaniards decided they wanted access to the river 1571, but instead of building a port where the Magdalena River meets the Caribbean Sea, they opted to build a canal between Cartagena and Calamar instead.In 1582, the colonists put 2,000 African and indigenous slaves to work to connect the wetlands west of the Magdalena River with the bay of Cartagena.Sediments from the river almost immediately accumulated in the canal, which made it impossible to navigate and the project was abandoned.The Spaniards had another go in 1630 and constructed the first levees, but ran into exactly the same problem.1794 map of the Levee Canal (Image: Canal del Dique)By the time Colombia became independent in 1819, the Levee Canal was a muddy road rather than a waterway.After the invention of the steamboat that was able to transport more freight up the Magdalena River, regional governments expanded the levee system in 1844.Accumulating sediment continued to make permanent passage impossible.In the late 19th century, the government gave up and built a railroad between Cartagena and Calamar instead.The successful construction of the Panama Canal in 1914 made the National Government believe that a canal connecting Cartagena with the Magdalena River was no longer a lost cause.The government hired the first of a series of foreign construction companies to properly construct the canal in 1923 and destroyed the railroad in 1953.Late dictator Gustavo Rojas inaugurated an oil refinery in Cartagena despite the fact that was no oil anywhere in the Caribbean region.The ongoing sediment problem blocked the canal again in 1960, making fluvial oil transports impossible and spurring another upgrade in 1961.The last attempt to upgrade the Levee Canal began in 1980, but was abandoned because of financial woes in 1984.The environmental disastersDead corals in the Cartagena Bay (Image: Corales de Paz)The construction and the upgrades of the canal have a major effect on the water flowing from the Magdalena River into wetlands, which dramatically altered the local ecosystem.The challenge is to control the flow of an artificial canal that was widened and rectified three times without previous studies of alternatives in the 20th century. It’s as simple as that. Since its widening in 1984, its force has breached the north wall near Santa Lucia twice, flooding the region of its former swamps and causing severe suffering to the inhabitants of the region.Historian Jose Vicente MogollonThe upgrades made since 1923 allowed the Magdalena River’s water to push the sediment through the canal and dump it in the Cartagena Bay, which has created an ecological disaster.Instead of accumulating in the canal, the river sediment accumulated in the bay where it formed beaches made of river sand and silt.Sediment deposit in Cartagena Bay (Image: Google Earth)Furthermore, the increasing amount of sweet water flowing through the canal has all but killed the coral reefs in the Cartagena Bay.Had it occurred to anyone in the past five centuries to build a lock gate where the water from the Magdalena River flows into the canal, these ecological disasters may have been averted.In fact, one could argue that a lock gate could have prevented much of the canal’s perpetual sediment problem.Ironically, the suspended canal project does include the construction of one sluice gates in Calamar and another one in Cartagena.Former Environment Minister Carlos Correa said in June that environmental authorities planted more than 38,000 corals in the Cartagena Bay to replace the reefs that were killed by the canal.Newly planted corals in Cartagena Bay. (Image: El Universal)Disgracefully, the project that sought to tackle the the coral reefs’ cause of death has now been suspended.Whether Cafyr, or any company for that matter, would want to include the search and possible exhumation of the remains of the thousands of people who were forcibly disappeared in the canal area is entirely unclear.What is clear is that Duque bungled the “Restauration of the Levee Canal’s Degraded Ecosystems” despite ignoring the locals.The war victims from the canal region were given a chance to perhaps find some of the remains of the thousands of people who were forcibly disappeared in the canal region.Locals who feared that the government would further destroy the wetlands and their livelihoods were also given hope. armed conflictBolivarCanal del diqueCartagenaenvironmentJEPvictims ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-suspends-most-important-project-of-this-century/,Colombia suspends ‘most important project of this century’
" Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro said Monday that peace talks with guerrilla group ELN “are about to be resumed.”Before taking office on Sunday, the president had already said that he would continue the talks that were suspended by former President Ivan Duque“In the coming weeks” Petro will know “if these talks will continue in Cuba” where ELN negotiators remained after the suspension, said the president after a meeting with his Chilean counterpart Gabriel Boric.Chile is a guarantor of the process carried out in Havana, Cuba, and we hope that it will continue to be a guarantor in the processes that are about to be resumed.President Gustavo PetroApart from possibly revising the location of the talks, Foreign Minister Alvaro Leyva will be talking to other guarantor countries about their future role in the talks, said the president.The formal talks with the ELN kicked off under former President Juan Manuel Santos in 2017, but were suspended after Duque took office in 2018.ELN negotiator “Antonio Garcia” said on Twitter that “we’ll have to look how to continue considering what has been agreed” between the guerrillas and the Santos administration.The planned resumption of the peace talks with Colombia’s longest-living guerrilla group is part of Petro’s “Total Peace” policy that seeks the demobilization of multiple illegal armed groups.Colombia’s incoming government begins “total peace” offensiveParamilitary organization AGC, which was also negotiating a possible demobilization with Santos, announced an immediate and unilateral ceasefire on Sunday “as an expression of goodwill.”The largest group formed by dissidents of the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC last week released a video in which they also said to be willing to negotiate their demobilization and disarmament.In his inaugural address, Petro on Sunday called on “all the armed groups to lay down their arms in the mists of the past, to accept legal benefits in exchange for peace, in exchange for the definitive non-repetition of violence.”We will work tirelessly to bring peace and tranquility to every corner of Colombia.

" Colombia’s new government wants to boost tax revenue to finance its ambitious agenda.Less than 24 hours after President Gustavo Petro was sworn in, Finance Minister José Antonio Ocampo presented Congress a tax reform that seeks to boost tax revenue with $5.5 billion in 2023.In 2026, the reform could increase tax revenue to $11 billion, according to Ocampo.This implies that Colombia’s tax revenue would go from 13% of the country’s GDP, one of the lowest rates in Latin America, to 16%, the regional average.How Petro wants to boost tax revenueRaise the income tax of the country’s top earnersIntroduce a progressive wealth taxTaxes on sugary drinks and plasticsRaised taxes for the oil and mining sectorSimplify tax system by eliminating exemptionsThe tax reform primarily seeks to raise the revenue to finance the government’s pending budget proposal that would seek to combat unemployment and poverty.This is necessary urgently after the coronavirus pandemic surged Colombia’s poverty rate to 35.7% last year, according to Ocampo.The State has a historical social debt. Inequality levels have been high and persistent. The purpose of this project is to make progress in two main areas: to reduce inequitable exemptions and to obtain sufficient resources to finance the strengthening of the social security system.Finance Minister Jose Antonio OcampoThe taxes that target fossil fuels are part of Petro’s plan to make Colombia less dependent on the exports of fossil fuels and create jobs in other sectors.The president was elected in June after promising that his economic policy would combat poverty and climate change.After his election, Petro has been able to form a majority coalition, which would help the government push its tax reform through congress.A tax reform proposed by former President Ivan Duque that also sought to increase tax revenue led to major anti-government protests in 2019 and last year. tax reformtaxes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-new-government-proposes-tax-reform-to-finance-ambitious-agenda/,Colombia’s new government proposes tax reform to finance ambitious agenda
" Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro ordered an unprecedented and controversial purge of the police as part of a reorganization of the security forces.Petro’s appointment of a new military command forced 21 police generals and 10 generals of the National Army into retirement and was met with mixed reactions, particularly inside the National Police.The president and Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez made army General Helder Fernan Giraldo the commander of the armed forces and General Henry Armando Sanabria director of the National Police.Why the police purge is controversialGeneral Yackeline Navarro (Image: National Police)A purge to compose a leadership of police and army generals whose philosophy is in line with that of a new president is normal.However, Petro’s made General Yackeline Navarro deputy police chief in order to “show that this world is no longer a man’s world and is beginning to have an empowered presence of women.”Petro’s promotion of gender equality caused controversy because Petro’s general equality policy caused a major clash with the National Police’s existing hierarchical order.This is because the security forces’ hierarchy doesn’t allow any commander to be outranked by their subordinates and Navarro was outranked by 21 generals.Generals stepping aside to maintain hierarchy is normal, but the retirement of the police’s 21 highest ranking generals is unprecedented in the organization’s 69-year history.Multiple anonymous commanders told weekly Cambio that Navarro’s appointment as deputy “weakened” the National Police.Some even said that the unprecedented mass retirement “dismantled” much of the organization.Colombia’s main political forces were significantly less pessimistic about the purge of the National Police, which has been marred by scandals over corruption and human rights violations.Colombia’s police inspector threatened as chief submerged in corruption scandalsRestoring Colombia’s military doctrineGeneral Luis Mariano Ospina (Image: Armed Forces)Petro’s reorganization of the National army was considerably less controversial.General Luis Mariano Ospina was promoted to commander of the National Army and will serve under Giraldo.Both generals are supporters of the so-called Damascus doctrine, which was developed under former President Juan Manuel Santos between 2011 and 2016 with the security forces of the United States and Chile.The Damascus Doctrine sought the adaptation of the security forces to possible threats posed after the 2017 demobilization and disarmament of the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.The military all but abandoned its doctrine under former President Ivan Duque, whose far-right Democratic Center party opposes the ongoing peace process.Colombia abandons Cold War military doctrine, gets ready for 21st centuryThe challenges aheadPetro reorganized the security forces as they are facing major challenges ahead.Ahead of his election, the president promised the first police reform since they were made part of the armed forces after a military coup in 1953.Petro has also vowed to seek a negotiate a “Total Peace” with illegal armed groups like guerrilla group ELN and groups formed after the partial demobilization of the FARC and paramilitary organization AUC.The president also vowed to combat corruption, which has particularly crippled the National Army and the police.

With patience, rigorous work and perseverance we will achieve Total Peace.Senator Ivan CepedaThe ELN’s negotiators have been staying in Cuba after former President Ivan Duque suspended the peace talks and refused to guarantee the guerrilla commanders’ return to Colombia in 2018.One of the guerrillas’ negotiators, “Antonio Garcia,” stressed earlier this week that the ELN has always maintained the will to negotiate an end to the group’s decades-long insurgency.Garcia stressed, however, that Petro’s “Total Peace” concept “is a false peace if it is reduced to only the absence of an armed confrontation.”According to the rebel leader, “treating social conflicts the wrong way will continue to lead us to armed uprisings.”Why peace talks with Colombia’s ELN rebels are so difficultHow certain are peace talks?Duque suspended the peace talks after his predecessor had already come to a number of partial agreements that were part of an agenda that was agreed with the ELN ahead of the talks.The ELN has sustained that these agreements continued to stand and has added that the guerrillas were willing to renegotiate points on the agenda to advance the talks.Petro, who took office on Sunday, has been consistent in claiming that he wants to continue Santos’ peace talks.The president has yet to confirm his commitment to the agenda agreed by his predecessor and the ELN.The talks between Santos and the guerrillas bogged down when the two parties reached the point about “citizen participation,” which would allow community organizations to make demands. armed conflictCubaELNpeace processpeace talks ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-government-talks-peace-with-eln-in-cuba/,Colombia’s government talks peace with ELN in Cuba

" Colombia’s State fails to provide any kind of security in the southwestern Cauca province where ethnic minorities have been under siege by illegal armed groups, drug traffickers and the military for decades.This week alone, illegal armed groups committed three massacres and assassinated one policeman in the province where the history of the local Nasa people goes back more than 10,000 years.Combat between two rival guerrilla groups forced more than 200 people to flee their homes in the rural part of Balboa, a municipality in the south of Cauca, on Wednesday.Colombia’s most violent provinceCauca is the home of Vice-President-elect Francia Marquez, who survived an assassination attempt while meeting with community leaders in Suarez in 2019.So far this year, illegal armed groups assassinated 18 community leaders and human rights defenders in Cauca, according to independent conflict monitoring NGO Indepaz.At least 246 social leaders have been assassinated and more than 170 people were killed in at least 48 massacres since President Ivan Duque took office in August 2018.The violence disproportionately affects the indigenous Nasa people who refuse to surrender their fertile territories in northern Cauca to illegal armed groups and regional elites alike.Who is killing the locals?The prime suspect of killings indigenous in northern Cauca is the CCO, a federation of guerrilla groups that formed after the 2017 demobilization of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC that used to control the area.Following the demobilization of the FARC, the Nasa people stepped up efforts to rid their territories of illicit crops left by the demobilized guerrillas.At the same time, however, the guerrillas began planting coca in areas with easy access to the Pacific port city Buenaventura in particular, including inside indigenous territories and the jungles north of Cauca.In the Pacific region of Cauca, another FARC dissident group, “Segunda Marquetalia,” has been violently trying to expel the CCO in order to assume control over the coca that is grown there apparently with the help of local ELN guerrillas.Pamphlets of the AGC that have appeared in El Tambo and Argelia indicates that this paramilitary organization is trying to expel all guerrilla groups from the Pacific region, which is also rich in gold.To further complicate matters, Medellin organized crime syndicate “La Oficina de Envigado” has been promoting the cultivation of marijuana in the north of Cauca for consumption in Colombia’s second largest city.On top of the conflicts with the guerrillas and the narcos, the Nasa people have been involved in a decades-long dispute over sugar plantation in the indigenous ancestral lands in northern Cauca.In a 2021 meeting with the Truth Commission,Tensions between indigenous and plantation owners in southwest ColombiaWhere did the security forces go?The National Army has been carrying out attacks against the guerrillas in the west and north of Cauca, which has caused tensions with the locals.The Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC) said Wednesday that both the army and the guerrillas were using the inhabitants of an indigenous reserve in northern Cauca as a human shield.Today, August 2, in the town center of the Las Delicias reserve, there were reports of combat between the Jaime Martinez mobile column and the National Army. The community members had to take refuge from the crossfire in their homes. These armed groups are using the civilian population as a human shield… At 2:30 in the afternoon, the combat moved to La Chapa hill, where the Indigenous Guard had to evacuate an educational center, protecting the students from the armed confrontation.Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca#ATENCION, área de DDHH de @ACIN_Cauca denuncia el regreso de confrontación Armada en el resguardo indígena de Las Delicias #BuenoAires y la Concepción en #SantanderQ población en confinamiento, niños evacuados de escuelas con ayuda de #Guardiaindigena@ONUHumanRights @WOLA_org pic.twitter.com/3p4Y4QxUBS— Eduin Mauricio Capaz Lectamo. (@CapazMauricio1) August 2, 2022In the Pacific region, communities have been expelling counternarcotics units since February.According to these locals, the army is forcibly eradicating coca while the government promised the farmers substitute crops that would allow them to sustain themselves.Meanwhile, the military appeared to ignore known drug trafficking routes, Alejandra Miller of the Truth Commission said last year after studying the situation the region for three years. We are asking ourselves different questions that will help us to solve what is behind this. One of them is why the public forces do not take control of known illegal economic routes.Truth Commissioner Alejandra MillerThe military’s drug trafficking tiesMounting evidence indicates that corrupt elements within the National Army are colluding with the very drug traffickers that are causing the security crisis in Cauca.In February, the National Army was forced to sack a general after he admitted to working together with a local drug trafficking gang in the marijuana-growing region.The general was has yet to be arrested.Colombia’s army sacks general over admitted drug tiesThe scandal involving the general, the army’s failure to effectively combat drug trafficking and the constant attacks on the civilian population have deteriorated locals’  confidence in the State, according to Valeria Mosquera of human rights organization Ruta Pacifica de Mujeres.We are in the midst of a sense of impunity that sends a very negative message to the population. There is a public message being sent to society about the reduced capacity of the justice system to solve the clarification of the facts of persistence. A second phenomenon is the lack of confidence in the institutions.Human rights defender Ruta Pacifica de MujeresAccording to indigenous leader Edwin Mauricio Capaz, “there are interests in maintaining the region unstable, powers that need to invalidate local organizational processes by the indigenous and the black community, powers that use the violence to maintain their local hegemony.”According to Capaz, this may change on Monday if President-elect Gustavo Petro kicks off his first day as president with a trip to Cauca. armed conflictCaucaFailing state seriesindigenous issuespeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-failing-state-part-6-indigenous-under-siege/,Colombia’s failing state | Part 6: indigenous under siege
" Medellin is a dangerous city for women and girls despite alleged efforts to combat gender violence and pedophilia in Colombia’s second largest city.Forty women and girls were assassinated in the city last year, according to local authorities in the capital of the Antioquia province that is home to more than 2.5 million people.Fifteen of these victims were murdered at home, one of the most dangerous places for Medellin’s women and girls.In its annual report on women’s rights, the local government said that 1,568 women were physically abused by their partner and 133 girls suffered physical abuse by a family member.At least 2,008 women and children became the victims of sexual violence in 2021. Of the 466 rape tests carried out by the Medical Examiner, 90% corresponded to underage girls.Family environments are proportionally more dangerous for women because of the type of violence that is exercised against them, and because of the way in which this type of violence associated with coexistence, interpersonal and the relationships between couples.Medical Examiner’s OfficeThe situation is considerably better than it was in 2005 when Medellin’s Women’s Secretary was founded and 61% of the city’s women said they had been beaten by their partner.Sixty women were assassinated that year, the local government in a 2008 report.In 2007, the Medical Examiner carried out 933 rape tests of which 70% corresponded to girls of 14 and younger.The impoverished northwest of the city was the most dangerous for women then and continued to be so in 2021, according to Medellin’s city hall.What is threatening Medellin women and girls?The coronavirus and the massive influx of migrants from Venezuela has had a devastating effect on women in the city with a history of “machismo.”According to national statistics agency DANE, 18% of Medellin’s women were unemployed. The unemployment rate among women was as high as 31.7%.The physical and job insecurity severely affected the mental health of Medellin women of whom 36% said to be having mental health issues.Firefighter drags the naked body of murdered woman from the Medellin river.Medellin’s suicide rate was 2.7 per 100,000 women last year, which was double that of the capital Bogota and the highest of all Colombia’s major cities.The vulnerability of women that belong to ethnic minorities is considerably higher than white women as they additionally face racist violence, stressed Maria Roa of the Afrocolombian Domestic Service Union.The main challenges to improve equality and to be able to have a better quality of life for women and reduce the gender gap, is the guarantee of labor and human rights such as: having a fair salary, social benefits, reducing the domestic workload and the burden of the home, eliminating ethnic-racial discrimination, economic violence, sexual violence, workplace violence and having a dignified treatment.Maria RoaKeeping the problem a secretMedellin girls at a well-known site for prostitutionFor some reason, women’s rights wasn’t an issue in Medellin until sex workers also began offering their services to reported sex tourists in the wealthy Poblado district.Prostitution has been as common as violence against women in Medellin since before 1963 when a survey found that more than 4.5% of the local women worked in prostitution.According to a 2012 study by the Health Ministry, a little more than 2,000 women and more than 270 children provided sex services to the male half of the city’s 2.2 million inhabitants.I started when I was 11 years old. I was in a boarding school where met a friend who told me to come here and you know when they say “money, money,” it calls your attention.“Astrid”The local child welfare service told local news station Telemedellin that it received only seven complaints of child sexual exploitation that year.The situation caused little public indignation as prostitution mainly took place in the downtown area and the sexual violence against women and children at home.Medellin project aims to curb sex tourism, telling visitors to ‘buy other souvenir’The public indignation kicked in in 2016 after a growing number of foreigner visitors to Poblado also began attracting sex workers to Medellin’s most affluent area.Local crime expert Fernando Quijano told Vivir en Poblado that year that “we have reported this often, but many businesses said that this was… not true.”El Poblado has been a time bomb for many years… When looking for [the local mafia] bosses, they found them in that area.Fernando QuijanoQuijano said “the situation is now out of control after Medellin mafia syndicate La Oficina de Envigado and Poblado businessmen had been making money of Poblado’s booming sex industry for years.The US-funded fraudFormer Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez (Image: Twitter)Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez embarked on a US-funded, but fraudulent witch hunt that targeted foreign visitors, but left the mafia associates of his now-jailed former security secretary alone.ICE embroiled in major fraud scandal in ColombiaMayor Daniel Quintero, an alleged sex offender, took office in 2020 and was almost immediately confronted with the coronavirus crisis, which worsened the situation of Medellin’s women dramatically.The pandemic was a godsent for the sex industry, however, and the local mafia flooded the city center and El Poblado with sex workers again.The minimum price for sex in downtown Medellin dropped to little more than $1 and in El Poblado to $20, according to sex workers’ rights organization “Putamente Poderosas.”Worse than an “open-air brothel”Medellin cop poses with taxi driver who allegedly raped a female customerAfter author Carolina Sanin called Medellin “an open-air brothel” on Monday, Quintero “finally” vowed to do something about prostitution, local newspaper El Colombiano reported.Dozens and dozens of women walk at any hour along 10th Street or Lleras Park in search of a client, and those clients are mostly foreigners who pay in dollars.El ColombianoThe newspaper complained that the city hall’s announced efforts “don’t even directly impact” the prostitution in El Poblado.Quintero’s policy allegedly seeks to tackle Medellin’s history of violence against women and children instead of the sensitivities of the local elite and the mafia that promote prostitution.I have a client and first I take him to a nearby bar, or to a discotheque, the manager gives me a tip for taking that foreigner to spend money with them. That way everybody wins.“Luisa”Colombia’s second largest city “continues to be an absolutely exclusive society,” sex workers’ rights activist Melissa Toro told Spanish newspaper El Pais.While El Colombiano decried prostitution, local police arrested a taxi driver who allegedly raped and robbed a 33-year-old woman from Manrique, Medellin’s most dangerous district for women.The city’s Women’s Secretary hasn’t spoken out about the situation of Medellin’s women for months.

" The opposition to Colombia’s President-elect Gustavo Petro accuses the government coalition of trying to corruptly secure the election of an allied comptroller general.The accusations followed attempts by lawmakers loyal to President Ivan Duque to do the exact opposite before they left office on July 20.The debate is particularly heated because a 2018 constitutional amendment gave the successor of Comptroller General Felipe Cordoba sweeping powers to investigate and punish government corruption.According to this amendment, Congress must elect a new fiscal watchdog before August 20 from a list of candidates composed by the previous congress before May 20.Why Colombia’s upcoming elections could trigger a crisisIs this even legal? | part 1Former Senate president Juan Diego Gomez (Image: Senate)Senate President Roy Barreras of Petro’s progressive Historic Pact party said on Monday that he will come up with a new shortlist, claiming that the one presented by former Senate president Juan Diego Gomez of the Conservative Party was invalid.Gomez began composing the shortlist on January 17, when Congress was on Christmas recess, in an apparent attempt to secure a list of 10 Duque loyalists.An administrative killed this shortlist on July 14, claiming that multiple of the candidates weren’t qualified and the list lacked female candidates.To make things worse, multiple of Gomez’s candidates were accused of embezzling more than $119 million (COP500 trillion) in funds meant for Colombia’s peace process.“Corruption cost Colombia’s peace process $119M”Is this even legal? | Part 2House President David Racero (L) and Senate President Roy Barreras (Image: Twitter)Gomez rushed to present a new shortlist before leaving office, but saw his second list of candidates discarded by Barreras and House President David Racero, another Petro ally.Barreras and Racero announced a resolution that created a provisional commission that would compose a new shortlist.Congress would have the final say over who would be investigating corruption in the coming four years in a secret vote on August 18, according to the Petro allies.Opposition politicians immediately claimed that what Barreras and Racero were trying to do was illegal.This definitely is ironicPresident-elect Gustavo Petro and Senator Rodolfo Hernandez (Image: Twitter)The corruption allegations hurled at Barreras and Racero are ironic as Petro won the elections earlier this year vowing to combat the corruption that marred the Duque administration.The president-elect won’t take office until Sunday, but is already facing a scandal over the alleged corruption by two of his most powerful allies in Congress.Petro had already come under fire from hardliners within his party over the efforts to secure a congressional majority with political parties that are notoriously corrupt.Protests grew louder last week after Petro’s allegedly corrupt opponent in the elections, Senator Rodolfo Hernandez, was appointed president of a congressional commission to investigate corruption.

" Colombia’s outgoing President Ivan Duque has divided media between allies and enemies, which contributed to polarization in the country and limited citizens’ access to information, according to press freedom foundation FLIP.Duque ended his May interview with BBC’s program HARDtalk, claiming its name “should be HARDlies” after host Stephen Sackur debunked multiple of the president’s false claims with facts.Duque’s growing aggression against the BBC host and his final statement was typical the outgoing president’s relations to critical members of the press that refused to become Duque’s propaganda tools.In the interview, the president falsely claimed that Colombia’s homicide statistics were the lowest in history while they were the highest since 2015, according to the Defense Ministry.Despite Sackur’s pushback and the facts, Duque insisted that his claim was accurate and — to the amusement of many — ultimately claimed that the BBC was spreading lies.The interview was telling how the president over the past four years has made a clear distinction between “allied” media that allowed Duque to make all kinds of false claims and “enemy” media that were shunned for exposing the government’s barrage of lies, half truths and utter nonsense.Rebuilding Colombia Reports after 4 years of repressionBuilding the propaganda machineIn an attempt to strengthen his communication, the president expanded his propaganda team from 15 people to 54, and invested more than $10.3 million (COP 45 billion) to dominate the public discourse with his fabricated narrative.The team monitored media and journalists in order to define which were deemed positive about the Duque regime and which were “negative” and had to be countered, particularly during one of the government’s many crises.Meanwhile, violence against the press intensified. At the end of Duque’s four years, five journalists were assassinated and 750 journalists were threatened with censorship.Duque reverting freedom of the press to Colombia’s ‘darkest days’“Allies” and “enemies”Hassan Nassar (Image: RCN Radio)After taking office in 2018, the president briefly tried to maintain cordial relations with the press, but this quickly ended and journalists became either “allies” or “enemies,” which helped create a climate of polarization, according to the FLIP.“We know that there are media that don’t like us, that there were media that supported “Yes” [during the 2016 campaign that sought the public approval of a peace deal with now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and are friends of [former President Juan Manuel Santos,” one of Duque’s advisers told the president, according to an anonymous former adviser, who added that “that sentence left me worried.”“You can’t being a government with a predisposition for the attack,” the former adviser told FLIP and let to the government’s believe that some media were part of the political opposition.The beginning of the censorshipFormer Noticias Uno anchor Mabel LaraThree months after taking office, Duque’s public television chief Juan Pablo Bieri censured a television program whose host was too critical about the government’s “ICT modernization Law,” which gave the administration almost absolute control over the content on public TV and the allocation of radio frequencies.Bieri was sacked and immediately hired as one of the president’s communications advisers after which the official help organize a WhatsApp groups with loyalists of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party that sought to silence criticism by media and political opponents of the government.‘Democratic character of Colombia’s state put to the test’: press freedom foundationProfiling social media critics, spying on journalistsAfter the president’s popularity collapsed in 2019 and anti-government protests were being organized, the president hired a firm to “construct a narrative that would make good Colombians disapprove the motivations of those who marched” against the administration.The President’s Office also sought to label influential citizens on social media as “positive,” “negative,” and “neutral.”Weekly Semana additionally published evidence indicating that the National Army had been spying on more than 70 journalists and other public figures, which exposed that the army was managing a list of “opposition” politicians.Colombia’s army spied on court, politicians and journalists: reportPublic uproar forced a change in the president’s communication team and the appointment of far-right pundit Hassan Nassar as Duque’s top communications adviser.Nassar quickly showed that that any journalist asking critical questions would be accuse of having ties to Santos. Media subsequently avoided the president’s communications chief, who became the laughing stock of internet trolls.Press freedom in Colombia deteriorated in 2019 amid persistent aggression and self-censorshipPoliticized public service announcementsDuque hosting his daily showThe coronavirus pandemic that broke out in Colombia in March 2020 triggered Duque to host a daily propaganda program that was broadcast on corporate television networks deemed loyal to the government.Until March that year, the president gave 272 interviews to these corporate media and made 327 public statements that were loyally broadcast by them.The strategy sought to “exercise a control over the information that was going round,” according to political news website La Silla Vacia.The president’s daily “Prevention and Action” program that was initially introduced to inform people on the progress of the coronavirus turned out to be a disaster for radio news programs that broadcast in the morning, but had to wait for answers until the evening.Additionally, independent media deemed hostile by the president’s inner circle were shunned, which ended up isolating the president ahead of April 2021 when social organizations began organizing a new National Strike that sought to revive the massive 2019 protests.The tragedy of Hassan Nassar, Colombia’s propaganda chiefCriminalizing protestsThe president’s daily broadcast gradually reduced information on the coronavirus and increasingly became a propaganda program that highlighted Duque’s self-proclaimed successes and broadcast claims that sought to discredit and criminalize the impending protests.A week after the 2021 National Strike erupted the program was taken off the air and the corporate television stations loyal to the government began criminalizing the protests based on “intelligence” provided by the security forces.The FLIP said that press conferences were held exclusively for corporate media that replicated the government’s talking point.Duque additionally extended the maximum term for open information requests to two years, making it virtually impossible for news media to inform their audiences on information that had not been vetted by the president’s propaganda team.On May 21, 2021, as Duque came under international pressure over his violent crackdown of the largely peaceful protests, the president published to publish fake interviews in English to manipulate international opinion and blame opposition leader Gustavo Petro of the unrest.The auto-interviews further distanced the president from citizens as most didn’t understand a work Duque was saying.Fact-checking website ColombiaCheck later published that 46 of the 96 claims made by Duque in these interviews with himself were “questionable,” 19 were false 16 were true, but deceitful and only 15 were simply true.On May 7 last year, the security forces and government website simulated a cyber attack on its social media platforms and some websites in order to justify the “cyber patrol” of 1.7 million citizens’ social media accounts, of which some were branded as “fake news” because they published content that had not been approved by the military and the National Police.Colombia Reports’ Facebook page taken down in apparent cyber warBailouts and trudgensJournalists being assaulted by police (Image: Twitter)Tensions between the corporate media that were given interviews by the president and replicating government lies increased tensions with anti-government protesters that one multiple occasions attacked these media’s offices or exposed their reporters to aggression.In order to help these media, the government offered bailouts that were withdrawn in September because of the government’s attempt to further control these media’s news programming.Hundreds of journalists reporting on the protests, and particularly the mass violation of human rights that sought to quell them, were injured, mainly by police.By the end of Duque’s term, Duque had burned many of the bridges with the press and was unable to respond to particularly harsh press reports about the human rights violations committed by his administration and the corruption scandals that had emerged. censorshipIvan Duquejournalismmediapropaganda ",https://colombiareports.com/how-hostility-to-the-press-ended-up-isolating-colombias-government/,How hostility to the press ended up isolating Colombia’s government

" Colombia’s chief prosecutor said Tuesday that Medellin’s former mayor owned four real estate properties that allegedly belonged to the local mafia.In a press statement, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa said that prosecution officials seized four real estate properties that were registered under the name of former Mayor and former Antioquia Governor Luis Perez.The alleged mafia propertiesThe properties allegedly belonged to Vicente Castaño, a late commander of the AUC with close ties to the Medellin mafia.The real estate would have an estimated value of $17 million (COP74 billion), said Barbosa.The prosecution allegedly found the homes as part of a criminal investigation into the AUC that followed the partial demobilization of the paramilitaries between 2003 and 2006.Barbosa made no mention of alleged ties between Castaño and Perez.Real estate and drugsAccording to a former AUC commander Rodrigo Alberto Zapata, a.k.a. “Ricardo,” Castaño received Perez’s properties from three regional drug traffickers to pay off an outstanding debt.The former mayor said that the chief prosecutor was “completely disinformed” and that he had bought one of the properties of  the granddaughter of late dictator Mariano Ospina in 2006.According to Perez, Castaño’s name never appeared on any of the documents related to the real estate.The Medellin mafia and the regional eliteRicardo’s paramilitary group, “the Southwestern Front,” had ties to former Senator Mario Uribe, a cousin of former President Alvaro Uribe and a neighbor of former drug lord “El Tuso.”The former AUC commander accused Uribe’s former presidential adviser Jose Obdulio Gaviria, the cousin of late drug lord Pablo Escobar, of supporting the Southwestern Front in 2016.One of Uribe’s closest allies, former Antioquia Governor Luis Alfredo Ramos, is in prison because of his ties to El Tuso and “La Oficina de Envigado,” the Medellin crime syndicate founded by Escobar in the 1980’s.Colombia’s presidential palace became home to criminal organization under Uribe: courtPerez and La OficinaExtradited crime lord “Don Berna” and the Castaño’s brothers founded the AUC and took over La Oficina after they split from the Medellin Cartel in 1991 and helped kill Escobar in 1993.Perez was was mayor of Medellin between 2001 and 2004 when Berna controlled Colombia’s largest city and the AUC’s drug trafficking activities.The former tried to run for mayor again in 2011, but lost those elections to Governor Anibal Gaviria after then-Mayor Alonso Salazar, accused Perez of using La Oficina to buy votes.Medellin: Colombia’s extrajudicial execution capitalThe regional politician successfully campaigned to become governor of Antioquia between 2016 and 2019 and briefly, but unsuccessfully tried to run for president earlier this year.Perez is locally known as “Luis XV” for alleged charging a 15% kickback in return to the granting of government contracts.

" The expansion of illegal armed groups is the main reason for increased violence in Colombia, according to the United Nations’ human rights agency HCHR.In a press statement, HCRH director Juliette de Rivero expressed her support of the “solid” peace policy proposal of President-elect Gustavo Petro, who will take office on August 7.The HCHR’s annual report confirmed a sharp increase in violence and armed conflict in 2021.Particularly forced displacement surged last year for the first time since 2016 when former President Juan Manuel Santos and the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC made peace.The number of victims of forced displacement went up from 26,191 in 2020 to 73,974 last year, according to the UN agency.The HCHR confirmed the assassinations of 100 human rights defenders last year.The UN agency stressed that four leaders of the indigenous Nasa people were assassinated in their native Cauca, a province in southwest Colombia in the first four months of 2022.In the south of the country, the ongoing armed conflict is accelerating the extinction of the Jiw people who live along the banks of the Guaviare river.In both regions, FARC dissident groups that oppose the peace process have taken control.In the northeastern Arauca province, these groups are at war with guerrilla group ELN.In the northwestern Choco and Antioquia provinces, violence is largely due to conflict between the ELN and paramilitary organization AGC.The violence allowed massacres to double between 2016 and 2021.“It is the State’s duty to protect the population, and to do so in a manner respecting international human rights law. This is why we are urging the Government to efficiently respond to and prevent further violence,” said the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.“The military response is not enough to curb the violence,” De Rivero added.The HCHR urged the government to implement the.2016 peace deal, policies that would allow the dismantling of illegal armed groups, and a more effective State presence in areas that have long been left at the mercy of illegal armed groups. armed conflictUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-illegal-armed-groups-violently-expanded-in-2021-un/,Colombia’s illegal armed groups violently expanded in 2021: UN
" Colombia’s national army commander celebrates his retirement on Wednesday amid an escalation of violence and corruption scandals.At least 10 generals and dozens of other commanders were either arrested or sacked because of their alleged involvement in drug trafficking, extortion, arms trafficking, embezzlement, and illegal spying on journalists and the Supreme Court since President Ivan Duque took office in 2018.At least 321 members of the security forces were killed after General Eduardo Zapateiro assumed control over the security forces in early 2020 and violence throughout Colombia deteriorated.Drug traffickingRetired General Leonardo BarreroThe scandals began in June 2019 when Colonel Elkin Argota was accidentally caught driving the fugitive drug lord from his hide-out in Bogota military barracks to the southern Putumayo province.A month later, the commander in charges of Putumayo, General Jorge Hernando Herrera, told colleagues about his ties to drug traffickers from Cauca, which got him sacked in February after this audio was leaked.Less than a week later, media revealed a prosecution report in which the former commander of the armed forces, General Leonardo Barrero, was accused of cooperating with a drug trafficker from the southwestern Nariño province.The latest scandal followed persistent claims by Catholic bishops from the Choco and Antioquia province that the regional military unit cooperated with paramilitary group AGC, which is allegedly Colombia’s largest drug trafficking organization.These claims were fiercely denied by the 7th Division, which controls this region in northwest Colombia.Arms traffickingThe former commander of the 4th Brigade, employees of Colombia’s weapons manufacturer Indumil and the director of the National Army’s family welfare agency, Colonel Alexander Amado, were accused of arms trafficking in 2021.According to the prosecution, former 4th Brigade commander Jorge Romero, provided armed to organized crime groups in Medellin and the neighboring city of Rionegro.Amado and at least two of his subordinates allegedly managed a national arms trafficking network from the Tolemaida base in the central Tolima province, which also sold arms to groups formed by dissident factions of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.Illegal spyingReitred General Nicacio Martinez and General Eduardo ZapateiroDuque sacked his initial National Army chief, General Nicasio Martinez, in late 2019 after the president found that the army commander and military intelligence officials allegedly were spying on journalists, opposition politicians, the Supreme Court and even Duque’s chief of staff.The scandal caused major uproar in Washington DC because the military was allegedly using American equipment that was meant to combat drug trafficking.According to one of the officials that took part in the criminal activity, the illegally obtained intelligence information was sent to the president’s far-right party, the Democratic Center.Kidnapping and extortionGaula forces (Image: National Army)Months before the resignation of Martinez, the general’s nephew, Lieutenant Colonel Cesar Augusto Martinez, found himself implicated in kidnapping allegations.Ironically, the general’s nephew was the commander of Colombia’s anti-kidnapping unit GAULA at the time.Mora was quietly removed from his post in December last year despite prosecution claims that the Gaula chief was not involved in any criminal activity.Two months before, the National Army confirmed that it was investigating the commander of the Special Forces Division, General Eduardo Mora, after extortion allegations lodged by eight of his subordinates.Despite this investigation, Mora was transferred to Cucuta where he assumed control of the 8th Division earlier this year.Three alleged convictionsPresident Ivan Duque and General Eduardo Zapateiro.Zapateiro told newspaper El Tiempo in March that the army had opened 41 disciplinary investigations into allegedly corrupt military officials since early 2020 that resulted in three convictions.None of these alleged convictions and investigations were mentioned in the National Army’s annual transparency magazine DANTE, which was published in April.None of the 10 allegedly corrupt generals and the dozens of officials who found themselves embroiled in criminal investigations since Duque took office have been convicted.The army’s allegedly corrupt commander will retire on Wednesday after ending his scandal-ridden military career with an exorbitant celebration of Colombia’s Independence Day.The celebrations will be held without the 321 soldiers and police officers who were killed while Zapateiro was in office. armed conflictcorruptionEduardo Zapateiromilitary ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-army-commander-retires-amid-corruption-scandals-and-escalation-of-violence/,Colombia’s army chief retires amid corruption scandals and escalation of violence
" An alleged paramilitary offensive against Colombia’s police has left 15 officials and two civilians dead so far this year.The increased attacks against police officers has made 2022 the deadliest year for the security forces since the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC laid down its weapons in 2016.According to the National Police, 36 police officers have been killed so far this year.The majority of 15 officers who were murdered by alleged paramilitaries were killed after an AGC order to assassinate cops  that was allegedly issued on June 22.Groups formed by dissident FARC guerrillas allegedly killed nine policemen and guerrilla group ELN is held responsible for seven cop killings in regions under their control.Cop killings in 2022Suspected cop killersThe AGC’s alleged assassination orderAccording to the National Police, the recent surge in cop killings is due to an alleged reward offered by the AGC for every killed police officer.The paramilitaries offer between COP5 million ($1,130) and COP20 million ($4,525) for every assassinated cop, police told local media.The AGC has carried out similar offensive since the group officially announced its existence in 2013.The paramilitaries’ alleged “Pistol Plan” put police on their highest alert in the AGC’s heartland in the northwestern Antioquia provinces and along the Caribbean coast.The “pistol plan” followed a four-day terror campaign in May.AGC kill 26 during 4-day terror campaign in northern ColombiaWhy the violence?General Jorge Luis Vargas, the director of the National Police, told radio station La FM on Wednesday that the cop killings are the AGC’s “criminal revenge” for the police’s “strong actions against organized crime.”Francisco Daza, an analyst of think tank Paz y Reconciliacion, told Spanish newspaper El Pais that the offensive is a signal of the strength of the paramilitaries.The United Nations’ Office for Human Rights (HCHR) said that the territorial expansion of a variety of illegal armed groups caused a surge in violence that is mainly affecting civilians.Multiple NGO’s have blamed failures in the security and peace policies of President Ivan Duque of the increased violence by illegal armed groups and organized crime.Colombia subjected to worst levels of violence in decadesThe AGC has apparently stepped up its offensive against the police ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Gustavo Petro next week.Petro has vowed a radical change in the government’s security policy, and has opened the door for negotiations with illegal armed groups like the AGC in an attempt to dismantle them.

" Peace in Colombia appears to be linked to the government’s ability to guarantee democratic opposition to whatever is considered the “status quo” by those in power.The resistance of far-right regional elites of whom some have controlled their regions for centuries has additionally complicated both peace and democracy, especially after the rise of fascism in the 1920’s and the rise of communist guerrillas in the 1960’s.Political polarization between liberals and conservatives, fascists and communists, and ultimately insurgents and counterinsurgents has perpetuated violence that mainly targeted the civilian population.This article is a preview of Colombia Reports’ summary of the Truth Commission report that will be available exclusively for sponsors in the coming month. If you want access to this report and other perks, sign up for a few bucks a month.This polarization surged during the Cold War and created a political culture in which someone is either “good” or “bad,” “capitalist” or “communist” and ultimately a “insurgent” or a “counterinsurgent.”The situation got really out of hand in the 1980’s when drug traffickers began defending their interpretation of the “status quo” in an alliance with the security forces, far-right regional “clans” and sectors within the business community.Another factor of violence is the resistance of largely far-right regional clans against the emancipation movements or attempts to make Colombia a more democratic and inclusive society, which would oppose the status quo on a regional level and their ambitions to accumulate political power.Since the 1950’s, multiple Colombia’s governments have tried to promote democracy and, which has failed more often than it is not.Each and every one of these peace processes have somehow been sabotaged.The latest peace process, which kicked off after a peace deal between now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos, is struggling because of the persistent polarization, corruption and resistance from the regional clans.The far-right in ColombiaLa ViolenciaLa Violencia also triggered a mass expulsion of small farmers and peasants from the rich and strategically located Andean region to the coastal regions in the north and the west of Colombia and jungle regions in the east and the south.This mass expulsion was promoted by fascist President Laureano Gomez, who turned Colombia into a dictatorship in 1949.The 1886 Constitution allowed the president to also appoint governors and mayors, which gave the fascist wing of the Conservative Party absolute control in Bogota and virtually absolute control on a provincial and municipal level.The regional elites were particularly powerful as they commanded their own police forces and were able to rig the system to such an extent that they also controlled the regional courts.Gomez and the fascist governors additionally promoted the creation of paramilitary death squads to exterminate anyone deemed liberal in cooperation with the provincial police and the military.Moderate conservatives conspired with the military to oust Gomez and install a military dictatorship in 1953 after the dictator also went after them.General Gustavo Rojas immediately nationalized the police and offered amnesty and land to the liberal guerrillas who had taken up arms and were successfully gaining control over the countryside, particularly in the regions where they could count on large numbers of displaced peasants.The peace process was a success for half a year until the paramilitaries began assassinating demobilized guerrillas.The liberal guerrillas retook arms, this time with the help of communists whose party had been banned by Rojas.In an attempt to end the war, the leaders of the Liberal Party agreed to form the “National Front” regime with the conservatives and the fascists.This oligarchical regime would allow the parties to end the bipartisan war and alternate control over the national government in Bogota.The military ousted Rojas and Liberal Party mogul Alberto Lleras became president in 1958 with the support of the conservatives and the largely fascist regional elites.The National FrontLleras revived efforts to demobilize liberal guerrillas and the fascist paramilitaries, which allowed bipartisan violence to drop.The president also created the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform to seek land for the landless peasants and created so-called Communal Action Councils to promote the political input from community organizations.Lleras’ efforts had little effect, especially after the 1960 murder of communist peasant leader Jacobo Prias Alape, one of the key moments in the reactivation of the armed.Alape’s death triggered some of the liberal guerrillas to rearm together with other peasant communities with outspoken communist ideals.Among the liberal guerrillas was Manuel Marulanda, the founder of the FARC, whose community of peasants who were displaced to the south of the Tolima province during La Violencia took up arms, initially citing “self-defense.”The so-called “Republic of Marquetalia” founded by Marulanda and his friend, Jacobo Arenas, began to openly challenge the legitimacy of the Bogota oligarchy.This resistance was fiercely opposed by conservative Senator Alvaro Gomez, the son of the former dictator, who decried what he called the “independent republics.”There are in this country a series of independent republics that do not recognize the sovereignty of the Colombian State, where the Colombian Army cannot enter, where it is told that its presence is nefarious, that it drives away the people, or the inhabitants? There is the Independent Republic of Sumapaz. There is the Independent Republic of Planadas, that of Riochiquito, that of this bandit named Richard, and now, we have the birth of? the Independent Republic of Vichada.Senator Alvaro GomezLleras’ successor, the conservative President Leon Guillermo Valencia, took office in August 1962, a year after the Cuban Missile Crisis spurred concerns by US President John F. Kennedy and governments throughout Latin America about the threat of “international communism” in Latin America.Valencia, with the support of the regional clans, revoked Lleras’ agriculture reforms.Colombia’s armed conflict for some also a family affairFARCUS Army Coronel William P. Yarborough, a.k.a. the “Father of the Modern Green Berets,” advised the Colombian government to embark on a comprehensive plan that would seek the creation of new paramilitary groups to assist the military in fighting communist peasant communities in combination with rural development.In July 1962, the Colombian military launched “Plan Lazo,” which sought to bomb the “independent republics” that were supported by the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) and get rid of the rebellious peasants with a ground offensive.The military bombed the “Republic of Marquetalia” in May 1964, but failed to do serious damage to the community after which Marulanda took up the nickname “Tirofijo” and founded the FARC with the support of the PCC.A bunch of anti-National Front forces also formed guerrilla groups like the “National Liberal Army” (ELN), the “Popular Liberation Army” (EPL), the “Revolutionary Liberal Movement” (MRL), the “National Popular Alliance” (Anapo), and the “Independent and Revolutionary Workers Movement” (MOIR).Valencia and his liberal successor, Carlos Lleras, didn’t take further action against the guerrilla groups that posed no significant threat and in general weren’t really doing much unlike labor unions that were increasingly calling for strikes.These strikes were violently struck down after Valencia declared a state of siege, giving almost absolute powers to the military.The M-19Things changed during the 1970 elections when the National Front sought to extend its rule for another four years, pushing forward Conservative Party mogul Misael Pastrana.The unpopular National Front candidate was challenged by Rojas, the former dictator who had been in power between 1953 and 1957, with the support of Anapo.The elections on March 19 were marred by fraud claims after Pastrana surprisingly won.The conservative president further deteriorated the public approval of the National Front, especially after his Integrated Rural Development Plan, which allowed large landowners to claim agricultural land at the cost of small farmers.Pastrana also sought to revive the fight against guerrilla groups, but was surprised by the M-19, which was named after the date of the allegedly stolen elections of 1970 and announced an urban guerrilla offensive.Unlike the communist guerrillas, the M-19 promoted a nationalist and pro-democracy agenda.In 1974, liberal presidential candidate Alfonso Lopez won the first free elections since 1946, but failed to contain growing public unrest, which led to a National Strike in September 1977.The strike was struck down brutally and left 33 people dead, 3000 people injured and thousands in prison.The repression, the United States’ defeat in Vietnam and the Sandinistas’ overthrow of the Nicaraguan dictatorship only increased tensions between Colombia’s government and the increasingly unruly social movements, and triggered the guerrilla groups to announce that they also would seek the violent overthrow of the government.When Gustavo Petro was a guerrillaSecurity StatutePresident Julio Cesar Turbay decided to crush the growing resistance against the government with overwhelming force.Within a month after taking office, the liberal president issued the Decree 1923 of 1978 on September 7.With the “Security Statute” decree, Turbay declared a state of siege, restricted and suspended a number of human rights and began one of the most violent crackdowns of political opposition in the history of Colombia.Turbay’s authoritarianism had little effect on the guerrillas, but submitted political opponents to state terror and a flurry of crimes against humanity, including torture and the forced disappearance of political activists.The Security Statute even allowed the military to create “American Anti-Communist Alliance” and the “Black Hands,” which carried out terrorist attacks on the leftist political opposition.Meanwhile, the president seemed hardly concerned about the Medellin Cartel, which was using its booming cocaine exports to expand its political power in Antioquia and Bogota.The Security Statute was one of the most anti-democratic policies implemented by any government since the end of the military dictatorship in 1978.Also guerrilla groups like the FARC and the M-19 began posing a serious threat to Colombia’s democracy, and began kidnapping predominantly drug traffickers and members of Colombia’s “oligarchy” to finance their revolutionary plans.Efforts to make peaceTurbay’s successor, the conservative President Belisario Betancur maintained the Security Statute, but also began to actively promote the political participation of the guerrilla groups that were trying to overthrow the State.Betancur’s peace policies were by far the most comprehensive of all his predecessors and sought to open up Colombia’s democracy to opposition organization and a National Rehabilitation Plan that sought to decentralize power and a solution to the problem of drugs.The president’s peace policies were opposed by the military, which believed that they could defeat the guerrillas through war, perhaps because of their increasingly close relationship with the newly elected Congressman Pablo Escobar and his Medellin Cartel.Also the far-right clans opposed Betancur’s peace policies. They also had begun aligning with the cartel and were able to expand their land ownership by laundering Escobar’s drug money.The three forces had just formed one of Colombia’s most powerful paramilitary groups, and were jointly exterminating anything that threatened the status quo.Betancur’s Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara frustrated the narcopolitical honeymoon in 1983 when the minister exposed Escobar’s drug trafficking activity, which forced the Medellin Cartel boss out of Congress.Lara was assassinated in 1984 after the minister and the police began going after Escobar’s money laundering associates among the regional elites and the military.How Colombia’s former president helped kick-start the Medellin CartelThe political exterminationThe majority of the guerrilla groups did like Betancur’s peace proposals, particularly the FARC which agreed to form a political party, the Patriotic Union, in 1984.The party, which also counted the support of democratic opposition forces, began preparing for the 1986 elections.The M-19 didn’t trust the process and intensified their guerrilla attacks, which culminated in the 1985 siege of the Palace of Justice of Bogota and the hostage-taking of the Supreme Court.The response of the military, which still enjoyed the privileges of the Security Statute, and bombed the entire justice building to pieces, killing 11 of Colombia’s Supreme Court judges and destroying the entire judicial archive of the Medellin Cartel.The UP’s electoral participation was surprisingly successful, but was also immediately cut down. All its congressmen elected in 1986 were assassinated by Medellin Cartel assassins and their allies in the military and intelligence agency DAS.The political party broke with the FARC to dedicate itself entirely on politics ahead of Colombia’s first local elections in 1988, and with success. The party won 16 mayoral elections, 95 coalition mayoral elections, 18 seats in provincial assemblies and 388 council members.In response, the paramilitaries and State officials began an extermination campaign that was never seen in the history of Colombia and 8,300 members and leaders of the UP were exterminated, according to the JEP.The paramilitary network of narcos, members of the military and members of the security agency DAS began a similar extermination campaign targeting human rights workers who had begun organizing in the late 1970’s to investigate the crimes against humanity committed as part of the Security Statute.In their defense of their interpretation of the Status Quo, the paramilitary network assassinated three UP candidates and Lara’s main ally, Luis Carlos Galan, ahead of the 1990 elections.Colombia’s war crimes tribunal: 5,700 killed in political exterminationA democratic constitutionBecause of the violence, the FARC and the ELN wanted nothing to do with political integration and focused exclusively on their military offensive.Guerrilla groups M-19, EPL PRT and the indigenous Quintin Lame, however, persisted and demobilized after Galan’s former speech writer, Cesar Gaviria, took office.Together with the traditional parties, social organizations and the guerrillas, a constitutional assembly approved the 1991 constitution, which is valid until this day.The new constitution did away with the authoritarian nature of the 1886 Constitution and introduced far-reaching democratic reforms, giving political rights to opposition parties and creating a justice system that would tackle impunity that had been the “root problem” of violence during La Violencia, according to a study commissioned by the outgoing military junta in 1957 and buried by the National Front.The new constitution triggered the creation of all kinds of community organizations, labor unions and rights groups like those defending the rights of ethnic minorities.The 1991 constitution also banned the arming of civilians or any form of paramilitary organization.Violent response to democratizationNotwithstanding, the implementation of the constitution triggered the worst escalation and the highest levels of violence as the paramilitary networks stepped up their terrorism activity to maintain the status quo as they saw it.The FARC and the ELN intensified their offensive to gain control over local and regional governments in guerrilla territory while the paramilitaries, the clans and the military embarked on their most aggressive terror campaign ever to exterminate anyone threaten the status quo and the accumulation of wealth after taking over the drug trafficking activities of the Medellin Cartel in 1992 and that of the Cali Cartel in 1994.Privatization policies that sought to decentralize power allowed both the clans and the ELN to line their pockets by acquiring former State companies for cheap.After the 1994 election of liberal President Ernesto Samper, the clans additionally were able to convince now-convicted Defense Minister Fernando Botero, a Cali Cartel associate, to create so-called Convivir groups that again allowed the arming of civilians, this time with legal financing from the private sector.Botero’s ally, former Medellin Cartel associate Alvaro Uribe, was elected governor of the Antioquia province in 1994 and began certifying the creation of many dozens Convivir groups as front companies of the paramilitary groups formed by other former associates of the cartel.Meanwhile, the FARC and the ELN sought to expand their regional political power by co-opting local and regional governments in the south and the east of the country.Samper banned the Convivir before leaving office in 1998, but by then the paramilitaries, their allies in the private sector and the regional clans had accumulated more power than ever before and began taking over the country with the help of the military.Colombia’s truth commission hears Uribe over war crimesRenewed peace effortsBy the time that conservative President Andres Pastrana, the son of the politician who allegedly stole the 1970 elections, took office, the country was on the brink of becoming a failed state, which got even worse after a financial crisis in 1999.Pastrana resumed peace talks with the FARC while the president was trying to bolster the security forces with the help of the security forces and the guerrillas were trying to bolster their armies by escalating their involvement in criminal rackets.Meanwhile, the paramilitary network expanded their political power and control over the economy.When the FARC peace talks collapsed in 2002, the AUC and their associates had gone from controlling a few regional governments and a few seats in the Senate to controlling 35% of Congress, intelligence agency DAS, and much of the military and National Police.Most importantly, they were able to secure the election of Uribe, one of their most ardent supporters since the Medellin Cartel.Testimony: how group on US terror list helped Uribe win Colombia’s 2002 electionsThe return of the clansAccording to the Supreme Court, the far-right president converted the presidential palace to the headquarters of a criminal organization.Uribe even got away with bribing Congress into changing the constitution in his first attempt to perpetuate power in 2006.The president’s second reelection attempt was struck down by the constitutional court in 2010 and liberal President Juan Manuel Santos was elected.Santos immediately purged the government of so-called “Uribistas” and began peace talks with the FARC in secret in 2011.How Colombia’s peace talks began and came to a successful endPromoting peace and democracy againThe talks resulted in a far-reaching peace deal with the FARC that sought to further promote the political inclusion of opposition forces and social organizations in 2016.Uribe was able to regain power in 2018 through the election of President Ivan Duque, a minion of the “Uribistas” whose campaign was financed by the mafia.The former president was forced to abandon politics in 2020, however, after the court ordered his detention over evidence exposing Uribe’s alleged organized crime activity.Duque tried to revert the 2016 peace deal with the FARC and in particular the war crimes tribunal that meant to expose the ties between the paramilitaries, the clans, the military and the private sector.The president also sought to obstruct the criminal investigations that began revealing evidence about Duque’s ties to drug trafficking and other organized crime activity in the courts.Duque succeeded in severely damaging the peace process and escalating violence to levels not seen in decades, according to the United Nations’ humanitarian agency earlier this year.Colombia subjected to worst levels of violence in decadesParamilitary project collapsesThe president’s apparent misrule and corruption, however, triggered the biggest anti-government protests in 2019 and 2021 since the National Strike held in 1977.Police crushed the protest with the use of more violence, which left more than 80 people dead and thousands injured, according to human rights organizations.Meanwhile, support for Colombia’s opposition grew ahead of the 2022 elections.Duque’s main opponent as former M-19 guerrilla Senator Gustavo Petro’s promised to do away with the status quo, and restore democracy and peace.The opposition politician won the elections with relative ease and has begun the preparations needed to assume power

" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal JEP ordered a convicted former governor to provide information about former President Alvaro Uribe’s alleged ties to paramilitary death squads.The former governor of the Magdalena province, Trino Luna, was sentenced to prison for his ties to paramilitary federation AUC in 2007.The JEP said on Wednesday that Luna’s case was transferred to the transitional justice system, which would allow the former politician to leave prison early if he cooperates.The former governor was convicted by the Supreme Court in 2007, but failed to provide information that would help identify the businessmen and politicians that made the Bloque Norte and its commander “Jorge 40,” as powerful as they were.The secrets of ‘Jorge 40’, the warlord who owned Colombia’s Caribbean regionAmong the conditions imposed by the JEP are Luna’s cooperation that would help to exactly establish how and with who the former governor helped the paramilitary group assume control of government institutions.Another condition is that the former governor provides evidence that would sustain his claims about Uribe’s alleged ties to the Bloque Norte.The JEP additionally wanted more information over the AUC group’s alleged ties to the director of tourism association Aviatur, Juan Claude Bessudo, and the province’s current governor, Carlos Caicedo.Between 1996 and 2006, the Bloque Norte was one of the AUC’s most powerful paramilitary groups and virtually controlled the Caribbean region’s economy and government entities.“Bloque Norte” committed 497 massacres in northern Colombia: prosecutionLuna is one of 87 congressmen and governors who were sent to prison by the Supreme Court for their ties to the AUC, which sought political power by promoting the election campaigns of political allies.The former Magdalena governor was one of the first to go to prison over his ties to the AUC and involvement in multiple corruption scandals.Luna is not the first who has accused Uribe of having ties to the Bloque Norte. Convicted paramilitary commander “El Canoso” testified years ago that his paramilitary group financed the 2002 and 2006 campaigns of the former president.Uribe was charges with fraud and bribery by the Supreme Court in 2018 over apparent attempts to conceal his alleged ties to the Bloque Metro, the now-defunct AUC that controlled much of Medellin and the surrounding Antioquia province.

" Colombia’s former opposition will take control of Congress in a historic session on Wednesday.The Historic Pact, the progressive party of President-elect Gustavo Petro, will be leading the government coalition after four years of opposition against President Ivan Duque.Petro’s party received the support of the other former opposition parties like the Green Alliance and Comunes, the political party formed by former FARC guerrillas who demobilized in 2017.The coalition will be reinforced by the traditional Liberal Party and the U Party and could receive more reinforcements in the coming month.The Historic Pact was also able to negotiate the presidencies of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.These positions give the government party major influence over the congressional agenda in the coming year.In the House, Petro will additionally receive the support of at least nine of 16 victim representatives who were elected as part of a 2016 peace deal between former President Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC.While on campaign, Petro vowed to accelerate the implementation of this peace deal that was fiercely opposed by Duque and his far-right Democratic Center party.The party of the president who is set to leave office on August 7, as well as regional “clans,” suffered a major defeat in the March elections.The Democratic Center announced its opposition to Petro’s “socialist” government.To what extent the incoming government will be able to implement their ambitious reforms will depend on the support of the clans that wield a lot of power in the traditional parties.This support may depend on the president-elect’s willingness to share administrative power with these regional forces.Petro is also opposed by Colombia’s corporate media that have historically defended their owners’ interests rather than that of the public.According to a recent poll, the incoming government can count on the support of more than 60% of urban Colombians. legislative order ",https://colombiareports.com/former-opposition-takes-control-of-colombias-congress/,Former opposition takes control of Colombia’s Congress

" President-elect Gustavo Petro will seek talks with illegal armed groups and a revised extradition treaty with the United States to achieve “total peace” in Colombia.Petro’s “Total Peace” policy would try to end a resurgence of violence that followed a 2016 peace deal between former President and guerrilla group FARC.Promoting “Total Peace”President-elect Gustavo Petro, UN Mission chief Carlos Ruiz (C) and future former Minister Alvaro Leyva (Image: UN)The president-elect and his progressive “Historic Pact” party have begun promoting Petro’s ambitious peace policy that is likely to generate controversy in Colombia and the US.United Nations mission chief Carlos Ruiz expressed his “support to Colombia to work for the consolidation of peace” on Monday after his first meeting with the president-elect.Vice-President-elect Francia Marquez told media that she is setting up a meeting with Kamala Harris, her future counterpart in Washington DC.Meanwhile, the Historic Pact has been lobbying in Congress and the media in order to win support for Petro’s peace proposals.The incoming government’s peace offensive coincides with an escalation of violence that has affected almost 3 million people so far this year, according to the UN’s humanitarian agency.According to the Historic Pact, Petro’s peace policy seeks to “completely end the armed conflict and prevent a new cycle of violence” through the implementation of five strategies.Colombia subjected to worst levels of violence in decadesReviving Santos’ peace processSenator Ivan Cepeda (Image: Senate)The primary strategy would be the resumption of the peace policy of former President Juan Manuel Santos that was suspended by outgoing President Ivan Duque.This means the full implementation of the 2016 peace deal with the FARC, particularly the rural, political and counternarcotics reforms that were suspended by Duque.While on campaign, Petro had already said that his government would also resume suspended talks with ELN guerrillas and paramilitary organization AGC, the country’s largest illegal armed groups.In an interview with weekly Cambio, the president-elect said he asked the Catholic Church “to establish channels for an integral peace process” with all groups generating violence.I believe that the Catholic Church today must play a fundamental role in the construction of peace in Colombia.President-elect Gustavo PetroUnder conditions, Colombia’s largest paramilitary group seeks surrenderNegotiations with FARC dissidentsFARC dissident “Ivan Marquez” (Image: Twitter)The Historic Pact additionally proposed talk with former FARC guerrillas who rearmed “because of the non-implementation of the deal” after 2016.These guerrillas were expelled from the ongoing peace process because they stopped complying with the peace deal they originally agreed with.I believe that it could be beneficial for the dissidents that arose due to the non-implementation of the Agreement to reincorporate themselves into the peace agreement and thus deactivate the FARC dissidents.Senator Ivan CepedaThis group of FARC dissidents would include the guerrillas’ former political chief “Ivan Marquez” and exclude guerrillas of what it called the “Southeastern Bloc,” which rejected the peace process before it began.In order to convince rearmed FARC guerrillas and members of the AGC, Congress would have to approve pending legislation that allows the collective demobilization of illegal armed groups.Demobilization of Colombia’s largest paramilitary group on hold: reportReforming the security forces(Image: National Army)Petro also wants to reform the security forces, which led to tensions when Santos tried something similar between 2011 and 2016.In an apparent attempt to reduce resistance within the military and the National Police, the president-elect vowed to improve their living conditions and career opportunities.Petro’s reform proposalsSeparate the police and the military Petro wants to separate the police and the military that both fall under the responsibility of the Defense Ministry in violation of international law.Abandon Cold War military doctrine The President-elect wants the military to abandon its Cold War military doctrine, which has been one of the main causes of human rights violations committed by the security forces. The “Damasco Doctrine” that was developed between 2011 and 2016 sought to achieve exactly that, but was abandoned by the military in 2020.Dismantle riot police unit Petro wants to dismantle controversial riot police unit ESMAD, which has been accused of consistently abusing its power to quell often peaceful anti-government protests.Improve cops and soldiers’ living conditions and career opportunities Petro wants to improve the living conditions of rank and file policemen and soldiers, and give them access to education that would allow them to be promoted to commanders.Colombia abandons Cold War military doctrine, gets ready for 21st centuryRenewed extradition treaty with USFormer AGC commander “Otoniel” before his extradition to the United States (Image: National Police)Petro will be seeking an agreement with the government of the United States to formulate an extradition treaty that would condition the extradition of alleged drug trafficking suspects to the United States.The current treaty is under fire because of its failure to effectively dismantle drug trafficking organizations and because of the extradition of war criminals on sometimes questionable drug trafficking charges deprives their victims of justice.The president-elect told Cambio that he wants to negotiate a new treaty that would help facilitate the “peaceful dismantling of drug trafficking” in Colombia.Colombia’s war victims clash with US government over extraditionGreat National AgreementThe peace deal signed by former President Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC. (Image: President’s Office)Last but not least, Petro wants to promote a “Great National Agreement,” which seeks to directly involve political parties, regional authorities, community leaders and minority organizations in resolving conflicts in the event they occur.This proposal specifically seeks a decentralized approach to the resolution of conflicts with a regional character.The “Great National Agreement” would seek a “culture of peace” through social events that promote peace and non-violent conflict resolution.Whether Petro will have more success than his predecessors in achieving “Absolute Peace” or even reduce violence in Colombia won’t be known until 2026 when the term of the president-elect ends. armed conflictGustavo Petropeace processpolitical violence ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-incoming-government-begins-total-peace-offensive/,Colombia’s incoming government begins “total peace” offensive
" Colombia’s Truth Commission recommended radical policy changes to prevent a repetition of violence and armed conflict that left the country traumatized.The commission published its long-awaited report on Colombia’s armed conflict and violence between 1958 and 2016 after a thorough study of more than three years.Apart from an analysis on the causes of the seemingly perpetual violence, the report also contained recommendations to different sectors of the State to guarantee peace.These recommendations were a major blow for President Ivan Duque, who appeared to have been dedicated to plunging Colombia in a new cycle of violence, according to newspaper El Espectador, which received a draft of the recommendations.Colombia subjected to worst levels of violence in decadesModernizing defense sectorThe Truth Commission urged the military to get rid of its Cold War doctrine, which was surprisingly restored under Duque in 2020 despite being one of the main causes of the security forces’ persistent human rights violations.The military developed a new military doctrine between 2011 and 2016 under Santos, but discarded this new “Damasco Doctrine” for no clear reason.The commission additionally recommended civilian checks and balances on military intelligence activities after evidence that indicated in 2020 that the National Army’s intelligence was illegally spying on human rights defenders, government critics and journalists.Santos disbanded now-defunct intelligence agency DAS in 2011 over its involvement in similar practices and terrorism.The commission also recommended background checks of military officials awaiting promotion to prevent the infiltration of organized crime or war criminals in the military command.The alleged corruption and ties to organized crime of Duque’s top security officials led to more than a dozen resignations and criminal investigationsArmy corruption: Colombia’s new ‘internal enemy’?Effective counternarcotics policy(Image: National Army)The Truth Commission recommended to end prohibitionist counternarcotics policies that became popular after late US President Richard Nixon declared a War on Drugs in 1971 and were revived by Duque in 2018.The commission also recommended an end to the president’s attempted flagship counternarcotics strategies, aerial spraying and the forced eradication of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine.The notoriously ineffective strategies soared cocaine production to record levels and fueled violence caused by groups involved in the drug trade.The commission also recommended the government to take the lead in an international debate on how to coherently combat the global drugs problem and Colombia’s exports of cocaine to consumer markets.Colombia admits $22 billion US counternarcotics strategy failedImplementation of peace policiesThe Truth Commission recommended a plan to accelerate the implementation of a 2016 peace deal between Santos and now-defunct guerrilla

comply with State obligations regarding the ELN peace talks and “deliberate” sabotaged of the peace process with the FARC, according to hundreds of civil society organization.Consequently, violence reached levels not seen in decades in the first few months of this year.Duque obstructed peace in Colombia ‘deliberately’Increased political participationPolice using teargas in a residential area in

brutality.The commission particularly urged to promote the political inclusion of rural voters who have historically faced major logistical difficulties to cast their vote in elections.The Truth Commission additionally recommended political parties to promote internal democratic processes to promote the participation of women and ethnic minorities.The commission also urged to make the National Electoral Council, Colombia’s highest electoral tribunal, independent from the political parties.The Truth Commission additionally suggested to design mechanism that would allow the formation of potential political leaders and representatives.The commission additionally recommended measures to facilitate peaceful protests and other forms of political participation, instead of repressing these.On the short term, the commission urged the prosecution to crate guarantees that would “avoid the use of the criminal justice system, police actions and other norms as mechanisms of repression of legitimate and peaceful social protests.”Police arrested thousands of peaceful protesters during a largely peaceful “National Strike” last year after which the prosecution jailed hundreds on apparently trumped up charges.Colombia’s citizen reporters: ‘you have the right to remain silent’Anti-corruption measuresThe Truth commission recommended to depoliticize the election of the Prosecutor General, who is currently elected by the Supreme Court from a presidential shortlist.This mechanism gradually eroded public confidence in the prosecution and plummeted after one of Duque’s best friends, Francisco Barbosa, was elected in 2020.The commission recommended the formation of a commission formed by national and international jurists to recover the credibility of the Prosecutor General’s Office.Last but not least, the Truth Commission recommended to revise the government’s extradition policy to prevent that the mechanism is being used to guarantee impunity in Colombia.Colombia’s prosecution shield against government’s narco tiesReparation for war victimsDesign of the planned memorial museum in BogotaIn order to optimize the reparation of Colombia’s more

" The party of Colombia’s President-elect Gustavo Petro is seeking a majority coalition in Congress.Petro’s “Historic Pact,” became the biggest political party in the congressional elections in March, but needs the support of other parties for a majority coalition.This formation process will be led by Senator Roy Barreras, a senior lawmaker who’s been a member of multiple parties in the past.Barreras met with the 20 senators and 28 house representatives of the Historic Pact on Monday to prepare them for the formation of a coalition.What is needed for a majority?In order to obtain a majority in Congress, Barreras will need the support of at least 54 senators and 95 representatives.Without a majority in Congress, Petro’s government wouldn’t be able to execute its ambitious agenda after taking office on August 7.According to Barreras, he will be reaching out to other parties in the hope they will commit to supporting Petro’s campaign promises.Petro’s prioritiesImplementation of 2016 peace deal between former President Juan Manuel Santos and now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and other peace policies that include a police reformSocial and economic policies in response to the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the war in UkraineEconomic and environmental reforms that would reduce Colombia’s dependency on oil and mining, and incentivize the creation of jobs in environmentally friendly sectorsThe most logical coalition party would be the Center Hope Coalition that was formed as an alternative party in opposition to Duque.Another possible coalition candidate is Comunes, the party formed in 2017 by former FARC guerrillas as part of the ongoing peace process.If Barreras is able to team up with these parties, the Historic Pact would still be 16 seats short in the senate and 45 in the House for a majority coalition.Senate seatsHouse seatsIn the House, the Historic Pact can count on the support of nine of the 16 victim representatives who were elected in March as part of the ongoing peace process, according to newspaper El Espectador.Far-right seeks opposition coalitionSenator Maria Fernanda Cabal (Image: Twitter)Senators of President Ivan Duque’s “Democratic Center” (CD) party announced they would oppose Petro from Congress.The far-right party that was founded by former President Alvaro Uribe, was Santos’ most vociferous opponent between 2014 and 2018.Life in the nation is about to begin a difficult era and we must prepare ourselves to face it, with the tenacity that the defense of our principles and values demands of us.Senator Maria Fernanda CabalThe CD is likely to receive the support from Evangelical parties that currently are part of the government coalition.Conservative Party leader Efrain Cepeda did not rule out forming part of Petro, but vowed that the party would “stay true to its principles” and “ defend democracy, freedoms, institutions, private property, free enterprise, and everything that has characterized it throughout history.”Key role for Liberal Party and offshootsBoth Petro and the opponents will be vying for the support of the Liberal Party and its offshoots, the U Party and Radical Change.These parties currently are part of Duque’s coalition and endorsed former establishment candidate Federico Gutierrez in the first round of the elections in MayThe liberals remained neutral ahead of Sunday’s run-off vote between Petro and runner-up Rodolfo Hernandez.Petro will need the support of at least two of these parties to obtain a majority in Congress.

" The historic election victory of Colombia’s President-elect Gustavo Petro is largely due to a massive increase in voter turnout.According to the National Registry, Sunday’s turnout was 58%, the highest since 1998.Voter turnout since 1938The increased voter participation was largely due to a spectacular surge in turnout in the Pacific region, where a lot of black and indigenous communities live.Vice-President-elect Francia Marquez is from the Pacific Cauca province where voter participation went up more than 22% compared to 2018.Increases in voter turnout compared to 2018Petro won along the war-torn Pacific coast where voter participation surged between 13% and 22%.Election results per provinceThis surge is extraordinary because armed conflict and the scarcity of polling stations make voting an extremely complicated enterprise.In Riosucio, a municipality on the Panamanian border, members of one community traveled two days in order to reach the nearest polling station.It is called the Darien Rainforest and yes, it takes 2 walking days from Puebloantioquia Chocó to Isleta, from there 4 to 6 hours by river depending on the amount of wood in the river (illegal deforestation)— Rafael Latorre (@Drrlatorre) June 20, 2022Marquez on campaign proudly referred to these marginalized communities as Colombia’s “nobodies” and apparently convinced these people to vote like never before.In her victory speech, the Vice_president-elect vowed that the government that takes office on August 7 will be “the government of the nobodies.” 2022 electionsFrancia Marquezpacific coast ",https://colombiareports.com/the-peaceful-revolution-of-colombias-nobodies/,The peaceful revolution of Colombia’s “nobodies”
" For the first time in history, victims of the FARC publicly confronted former guerrilla commanders with the suffering caused by their crimes against humanity.The three-day confrontation was part of the restorative justice process led by war crimes tribunal JEP in relation to the FARC’s kidnapping practices.During the marathon session, seven members of the FARC’s central command accepted responsibility for the kidnapping and forced disappearance of more than 21,000 people.Dozens of victims confronted the former guerrilla commanders with the suffering caused to those who survived the kidnappings and the families of those who never returned.ExtortionJonathan Mulford was kidnapped with his mother and brothers in 2000 when he was only 15 years old.The FARC’s leadership authorized kidnapping as a means to finance its guerrilla organization in 1982, which triggered a surge of kidnappings.Kidnapping victims and the families of victims who didn’t survive their kidnapping demanded demanded justice for the suffering caused by the FARC.Hector Angulo from the central Cundinamarca province told the former FARC commanders that his family has been tortured by feelings of guilt after finding the remains of their mother who was kidnapped with her husband in 2000.Apparently, guerrillas forced Angulo’s father to bury his wife in the jungle while their children were scrambling to pay the ransom fee. The anger is that my father left this world thinking that his children were incapable of asserting his rights. At this moment I demand that you assert my father’s rights, that you assert my mother’s rights. You destroyed and tortured a family, which is still being tortured.Hector AnguloFormer Congressman Gonzalo Botero, who was kidnapped by the FARC in 1991, told the former guerrilla leaders that the FARC financially ruined his entire family.The family spent decades paying off the debts they assumed to pay the $4 million demanded by the FARC to spare Botero’s life, the former politician said.After my release, Mr. “Martin Caballero” declared my family a military target. As a result, the 35th Front assassinated four of our workers in Sucre, all because of the these innocent farm workers’ “crime” of working for the Botero family.Former Congressman Gonzalo BoteroJonathan Mulford said that his father, a former dairy farmer, was too afraid to return to the countryside until last year after the guerrillas kidnapped his entire family in 2000.Italian immigrant Danilo Conta said he spent the past few decades “waiting for death” after losing his livelihood as a consequence of his kidnapping in 1996.Former FARC commander Pastor Alape broke down crying while admitting responsibility for the 2001 kidnapping and death of the brother of poet Maria Mercedes Carranza, who committed suicide in 2003 because of the FARC’s failure to return her brother alive.Social controlVictims filled the lobby of the Virgilio Barco Library with pictures of kidnapping victims who were forcibly disappeared. (Image: JEP)The FARC intensified their kidnapping practices in the late 1990’s in order to expel state authorities from rebel territory and subjugate rural communities to guerrilla rule.More than half of the 3,000 registered victims of the FARC’s kidnapping practices were deprived of their liberty as a form of  imposing social and territorial control, according to the JEP.The treatment of these kidnapping victims was particularly cruel as they were forced into slavery, tortured and/or assassinated only for being from a different part of the country.“Some were dismembered,” admitted former FARC commander “Pablo Catatumbo.”One anonymous kidnapping victim testified she was raped by three guerrillas after they chained both her arms and legs.Another anonymous victim said he was forced to slavery to pay off the “debt” he “owed” the FARC for the food and medical while held hostage on suspicion of being a paramilitary informant.The fathers of Aura Saavedra and Menfis Molano were forcibly disappeared after they were stopped at a guerrilla in the central Meta province in March 2005.My father’s partner was pregnant. What happened to kidnapped women who were pregnant?Aura SaavedraVladimiro Bayona demanded that the former FARC commanders not to let him die without giving his son, who was kidnapped in 2000, a Christian burial.Human leverageFormer FARC commander Pastor Alape breaks down. (Screenshot: Twitter)The FARC’s leadership decided in 1997 not to release captured policemen and soldiers, but hold them prison in jungle concentration camps in order to negotiate an “exchange” of captured guerrillas.After the government refused, the guerrillas decided in 1998 to also kidnap politicians in an attempt to force a “prisoner swap.”Some military officials were held hostage for more than 14 years, many were executed while trying to escape or died because they were denied medical aid.Clara Rojas, the assistant of former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, gave birth to a son who was subsequently taken away from their jungle prison.Many of the “political” hostages were subjected to psychological and/or physical torture, the FARC commanders admitted.This war made us lose our common sense.Former FARC commander Rodrigo Londoño.State neglect and persecutionRetired police sergeant shows the chains he was in for more than 13 years. (Image: JEP)The victims additionally deplored the neglect of the State, which revictimized many of the FARC’s kidnapping victims.According to Anyela Sierra, whose father was among the policemen who was forcibly disappeared by the FARC, the wives of soldiers and policemen “were stripped of their income.”Police officer Olmes Johan Duque said that he continues to be bullied by his colleagues about the sexual abuse he suffered while being held hostage by the guerrillas.I don’t know if you guys go to bed quietly or if you sleep because I don’t. I have to take medication to sleep or stay calm.Policeman Olmes Johan DuqueFormer deputy Sigifredo Lopez blasted the prosecution for throwing him in jail for half a year in 2012 on bogus charges that he helped the FARC coordinate the 2002 kidnapping of 12 deputies from the Valle del Cauca province of which he was the only survivor.Many of the FARC’s kidnapping victims said that the National Victims Unit neglected to recognize them as victims after Congress approved the 2011 Victims Law that gave them rights to reparations.What’s next for victims?The JEP hearings are part of a restorative justice process that seeks the active collaboration of the former guerrillas and the surviving victims of their kidnapping practices.This process involves the active cooperation of victims, the FARC’s former commanders, 295 former guerrillas and a special investigation unit dedicated to locating missing persons.War criminals who fully cooperate with justice will be given sentences that contribute to the effective reparation of their victims.Any war criminal that fails to fully cooperate will be sentenced to prison in accordance with common criminal law. armed conflictFARCJEPkidnappingpeace processwar victims ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-confronts-former-farc-chiefs-with-suffering-kidnapping-victims/,Colombia confronts former FARC chiefs with suffering kidnapping victims

" Colombia’s voters elect a new president on Sunday amid extraordinary tensions.The tensions are partly due to the possible victory of progressive Senator Gustavo Petro, one of the biggest critics of the increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque.The government has additionally  failed to guarantee free and fair elections, which has plummeted public confidence in electoral authorities.Petro and his rival, the allegedly corrupt demagogue Rodolfo Hernandez, have both claimed that opponents wanted to assassinate them during the campaign.The opposition campaign additionally claimed that they were the victim of spying after the release of edited videos of private strategy meetings.Defeated car-right candidate Federico Gutierrez used these videos to press criminal charges against Petro’s “criminal gang.”Fraud claimsThe campaigns of both candidates have claimed that the elections would be rigged to benefit their opponent.The software lost credibility after the organizer of the elections, Alexander Vega, left out almost 1.5 million votes in the preliminary results of the congressional elections in March.Vega subsequently failed to comply with a court order to audit the vote-counting software.This is delicate, because Petro and Hernandez could end up in a virtual tie on Sunday, according to recent opinion polls.The Independent Electoral Organization Mission (MOE) urged for a recount if the margin between the two candidates is less than two percent “in order to generate greater peace of mind and reliability of the results.”Illegal government interferenceThe MOE and European observers have questioned Inspector General Margarita Cabello for her failure to sanction state officials’ blatant opposition to Petro.The Constitutional Court additionally reprimanded Duque and his congressional coalition for their illegal suspension of anti-election fraud legislation in November.Former candidate Sergio Fajardo additionally blasted an apparently arbitrary criminal investigation into the moderate politician.Collapse of public confidenceThe accumulation of events has tanked the credibility of the election authorities, according to the MOE, which has been monitoring elections since 2007.Another independent monitor, Fundación Karisma, said that the trust in electoral authorities “broke.”Fear of violenceAuthorities and independent observers fear that the government’s bungling of the elections could lead to protests and violence after the results are announced.Vega responded that he would not accept anyone questioning the election results and Duque said that he would make sure that the security force would “make the verdict of the Colombian people respected.Both officials are being investigated for their alleged involvement in the corruption of Colombo’s electoral process. 2022 elections ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-elects-new-president-amid-fears-of-violence/,Colombia elects new president amid fears of violence
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque will leave the winner of Sunday’s election with a flurry of crises and a state apparatus that has been devastated by corruption.The misrule of the outgoing administration and the crises caused by external factors will pose a ghastly challenge after a new president takes office on August 7.Hunger and povertyThe ongoing war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic have surged poverty and malnutrition, which is affecting more than 20 millions of people in Colombia.Duque and his finance ministers have been unable to respond to the global crisis, which has caused multiple humanitarian emergencies.The inflation attributed to the war ruined much of the outgoing president’s efforts to respond to the effects of the pandemic.Colombia’s current poverty rate would be 32.1% and rise to 33.7% in 2002, according to the regional economic commission of the United Nations.This triggered the United Nations’  Food and Agriculture Organization to ring the alarm about hunger in the country earlier this year.War in Ukraine causing surge in poverty in Colombia: UNViolence and armed conflictAll kinds of violence erupted after Duque took office in 2018, according to government and independent sources.According to the defense ministry, more than 13,000 people were murdered last year, the highest number since 2013.Large parts of the country fell under the control of illegal armed groups that are vying for control abandoned by guerrilla group FARC, which disarmed in 2017.Also organized crime groups appear to have increased their influence over the past few years.Colombia subjected to worst levels of violence in decadesCorruption and crimeThe incoming president will assume power over a government and security forces that are devastated by corruption.Former President Alvaro Uribe has been charged with fraud and bribery and his party, the far-right Democratic Center, is being investigated for trying to rig the 2018 elections with the help of organized crime.Countless former army and police commanders have been linked to organized crime or have been accused of crimes against humanity.The newly elected Congress won’t be sworn in on July 20 and has already lost one Senator for allegedly running an organized crime organization from the capitol with the help of corrupt prosecutors.The corruption has crippled government and has destroyed public confidence democratic institutions.One of the presidential candidates, demagogic outsider Rodolfo Hernandez, is due in court over his alleged corruption just weeks before a new president is sworn in on August 7.Colombia’s first lady, slush funds and organized crimeWeak mandate and governmentWhoever wins the elections will face stark opposition in Congress and society at large.Hernandez would be facing the most powerful opposition of anti-corruption parties in decades as a consequence of the congressional elections.Opposition candidate Petro Gustavo would face a strong “anti-Petro” sentiment among voters who are represented by a significant number of conservative and far-right lawmakers in Congress.In order to be able to govern, the winner of the elections will have to form a majority coalition in Congress, which is only possible with the support of the Liberal Party and its offshoots.The corruption within these parties would further complicate the new president’s ability to effectively tackle the crises that have been destabilizing Colombian society. 2022 elections ",https://colombiareports.com/the-main-challenges-of-colombias-incoming-president/,The main challenges for Colombia’s incoming president

The recordings weren’t made by anyone from the campaign, so no one from the campaign has sent them. The recordings were made by someone outside the campaign.Senator Gustavo PetroJournalist Gustavo Gomez confirmed that videos sent to Caracol Radio had been edited.Petro’s “criminal gang”In response to the videos, former candidate Federico Gutierrez pressed criminal charges against Petro’s “criminal gang,” claiming that opposition was involved in criminal activity.Petro’s opponent in the second round of elections, liberal demagogue Rodolfo Hernandez, also referred to Petro’s campaign as criminals despite the questionable evidence.The Prosecutor General’s Office responded that it would verify if the videos contain evidence that would justify a criminal investigation.The prosecution also said that it will investigate the opposition’s claims that the videos were recorded illegally.Semana under fireThe publication of the videos revived a public debate about the questionable “journalism” of Semana director Vicky Davila, who is a member of a notorious crime family.Semana played a key role in the stigmatization of political opposition to President Ivan Duque, and anti-government protests that were held in 2019 and last year.Following the publication of the videos, journalists accused Davila of being “corrupt” and violating journalist ethics. 2022 electionsGustavo Petrosemana ",https://colombiareports.com/watergate-like-scandal-escalates-electoral-tensions-in-colombia/,Watergate-like scandal escalates electoral tensions in Colombia
" The rival campaigns in Colombia’s elections have both claimed that Sunday’s vote will be rigged against their candidates.The accusations suggest that the losing candidate may refuse to recognize the election results.Public confidence in the organizer of the elections, national registrar Alexander Vega, plummeted after major irregularities in the congressional elections in March, according to the independent Electoral Observation Mission (MOE).Opposition accusationsSenator Gustavo Petro on campaign (Image: Twitter)Opposition leader Gustavo Petro, who won the first round of the elections, told Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday that Vega had “a clear affinity” with his rival, outsider Rodolfo Hernandez.Furthermore, Petro said that “we detected alterations in the software” that would have corrupted the results of the first round of elections last month.They did not allow us to carry out the technical audit and the registrar failed to comply with the court ruling [that ordered an independent audit].Senator Gustavo PetroIn a response, the national registrar said that the opposition candidate “must accept the results” despite the fact that the opposition’s suspicions are shared with independent election observers.Fraud claims by the outsider campaignRodolfo Hernandez (L) and Ingrid Betancourt (Image: Twitter)The campaign of Hernandez also said that “there will be fraud” on Sunday.In an interview with news website El Independiente, former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt said that “Petro is buying two million votes.”All congressmen have been approached by the Petro campaign to offer them 200 million pesos as a starting point to bring them votes.  They have all the money in the world: from the cartels, from Venezuela, from the businessmen who owe them favors.Ingrid BetancourtBetancourt or the Hernandez campaign provided no evidence that would support the fraud claim.The far-right party of President Ivan Duque, whose candidate Federico Gutierrez lost in the first round on May 29, has been promoting a conspiracy theory that blamed its defeat in the congressional elections on an alleged conspiracy between the opposition, the national registry and one of the election software companies.Gutierrez last week pressed criminal charges against Petro’s “criminal gang,” last week, claiming that leaked videos of opposition campaign strategy meetings provided evidence of illegal activity.According to Petro, these videos were the result of illegal spying on the opposition.Watergate-like scandal escalates electoral tensions in ColombiaElection observers concerned about violence and “electoral peace.”MOE director Alejandra Barrios (Image: MOE)MOE director Alejandra Barrios warned that the national registrar’s failure to adequately respond to the irregularities in the March vote threatened “electoral peace” in Colombia.The MOE additionally raised the alarm that this year’s elections became the most violent in more than a decade in April already.The fraud claims are particularly delicate because neither candidate was able to secure a convincing lead in the election polls.Foreign observers blast government meddling in Colombia’s electionsWhat happens in the event of fraud?Electoral magistrates recount votes that were cast in the congressional elections (Image: Adriaan Alsema)Both candidates can demand a recount of votes of individual polling stations if they can provide evidence of possible fraud after polls have closed.The National Registry additionally allowed both campaigns to audit the vote-counting software, but has denied access to independent election observers.The preliminary results of the elections are expected to be announced on Sunday evening.The announcement of the final results that follow a scrutiny by the National Electoral Council are not expected until next week. 2022 electionsAlexander Vegaelection fraudGustavo PetroIngris BetancourtRodolfo Hernandez ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-elections-marred-by-violence-and-fraud-claims/,Colombia’s elections marred by violence and fraud claims

(Image: President’s Office)According to Gonzalez, the surge in violence is due to Duque’s neglect to implement a 2016 peace deal with now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and an “ineffective security policy.”The lack of commitment to implement the peace agreement, the ineffective security policy and the lack of comprehensive state presence in the territory are the main causes of this widespread violence during Duque’s term in office.Indepaz investigator Leonardo GonzalezTo illustrate the gravity of the situation, Indepaz said that 930 human rights defenders and community leaders have been assassinated since Duque took office in 2018.So far this year, 81 social leaders have been assassinated, according to the think tank.Assassinations of social leadersAt least 245 of the approximately 13,000 former FARC members who signed peace in 2016 were assassinated after Duque took office.In the same period, Indepaz registered 261 massacres in which 1,144 people were killed.Victims of massacres since Duque took officeAccording to the Defense Ministry, more than 58,000 people were murdered since 2019.In the first four months of this year, the police registered the highest number of homicides since 2013 when the FARC was still in arms.At least 6 soldiers killed in ambush in northwest ColombiaAlmost 3 million victims of violence so far this year: UNCar incinerated by alleged AGC paramilitaries. (Image: Twitter)According to the United Nations’ humanitarian agency OCHA, almost 3 million Colombians were affected by conflict-related violence so far this year compared to less than 119,000 last year.More than 78,900 of these victims were forcibly displaced or confined to their homes because of armed conflict, which has raged in the Pacific region and the northeastern Arauca province.These events have become more recurrent during this year, given the territorial control of armed groups over the population, especially towards ethnic communities… in rural and dispersed areas.OCHAMillions of people were affected by lockdowns that were imposed by guerrilla group ELN and paramilitary organization AGC earlier this year.Victimization rates so far in 2022Human rights violations by security forces soarHuman rights violations and crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the security forces also soared under Duque, particularly in response to anti-government protests in 2019 and last year.According to human rights NGO Temblores, 161 people allegedly became the victim of police brutality this year.Police assassinated at least 44 protesters and physically assaulted more than 1,660 people during anti-government protests that lasted between late April and mid-July last year, Indepaz said in April.At least 35 women were sexually abused by police during the protests, think tank said.More than 2,000 people were arbitrarily arrested, according to Indepaz.

" A Supreme Court investigation against a Liberal Party senator put the pet project of Colombia’s first lady at the center of a corruption scandal.The Supreme Court investigation against jailed Senator Mario Castaño also revealed that corrupt elements within the Prosecutor General’s Office tried to obstruct investigations into the corruption.Part of the “Sacudete al Parque” scandal was unveiled after the arrest of Castaño, who was accused of being the leader of an organized crime group dedicated to embezzling public funds last week.The Castaño ClanSenator Mario CastañoCastaño was arrested on Tuesday after the prosecution arrested one of his congressional aides and eight other alleged members of the senator’s alleged organized crime group in March.The senator’s right-hand-man, Juan Carlos Martinez, went on the run.According to the prosecution, the senator’s office in the capitol was the headquarters of a mafia that made $11 million (COP43 billion) from kickbacks they received from private contractors since 2020.Businessmen and other individuals allegedly frequented the congressman to benefit from contracts. In this sense, officials of various entities allegedly adjusted the contract specifications and conditions required in public works bids in different departments so that they would end up in the hands of the bidders indicated by the senator.Prosecutor General’s OfficeIn a wiretapped phone conversation, the senator told Martinez that he had been racketeering for 15 years.Since his election to Congress in 2014, Castaño had expanded his alleged criminal empire to at least five provinces in Colombia’s coffee region and along the Caribbean coast, according to the prosecution.Prosecutors on Friday seized 21 real estate properties and two businesses that allegedly belonged to the Senator in his native Manizales province and the cities of Medellin, Quibdo and Cartagena.The seized assets had a value of $1.2 million (COP5 billion), the Prosecutor General’s Office said.How the Castaño Clan allegedly operatedProsecutor General’s headquarters in BogotaThe Supreme Court claim contradicted the Prosecutor General’s Office, which said in March that it had “taken down” the corruption network working for the senator.According to the court, Castaño’s organized crime group was still active and included prosecution officials who kept the senator up to date about the details of the investigation.The organized crime group allegedly charged a kickback free of between 10% and 20% for every project granted by the Interior Ministry, the Supreme Court said Friday.Castaño additionally used his influence to bolster his political power through appointments in government organizations.The Supreme Court additionally accused Castaño of illegally managing the liquor production license for the western Choco province.Duque’s corrupt flagship projectPresident Ivan Duque and Interior Minister Daniel Palacios inaugurate one of the parks for which Castaño allegedly received a kickback from the city hall in Tulua, Valle del Cauca (Image: Interior Ministry)Castaño’s main racket was the flagship “Sacudate al Parque” project of First Lady Maria Juliana Ruiz that is being executed by Interior Minister Daniel Palacios.The multi-million dollar project is partly financed by the Inter-American Development Bank, the former employer of President Ivan Duque.Sacudate al Parque sought the development of, among other things, more than 338 soccer fields before 2024, Palacios said in August.Duque and his wife personally inaugurated the first three parks of 2022 in the northern Cesar province in January.Four months later, heavy rains destroyed the park in the town of La Jagua de Ibirico already.Two weeks after the arrest of Castaño’s alleged clan members in March, W Radio reported that the bidding process in 50 of  Sacudate al Parque projects were apparently rigged due to “a lobby by congressmen to favor certain contractors.”Notwithstanding, the Interior Ministry responded that it had “NOT received complaints about alleged irregularities in the selection process of contractors.”Rumors about a criminal investigation into the Castaño Clan started immediately after Palacios announced the project in August, according to news website Las Dos Orillas.The alleged machineAccording to the prosecution, Castaño allegedly used his growing criminal empire to also bolster his political power in Bogota.The senator allegedly lobbied the employment of clan members at the Family Welfare Institute, public education institution SENA, the Inspector General’s Office, the Comptroller General’s Office and the National Mining Agency.A week after the arrest of his alleged clan members in March, the senator was reelected with 68,315 votes, presumably with the help of corrupt associates as many members of the Castaño clan were already behind bars.The Supreme Court on Friday expressed the Castaño Clan’s influence in the Prosecutor General’s Office and ordered a criminal investigation into the prosecution itself.There is an imminent risk that the defendant and persons close to him and subordinate to him may alter the evidence that is about to be collected.Supreme CourtGovernment involvement in the embezzlementInterior Minister Daniel Palacios (Image: Interior Ministry)Castaño’s claim that he had been racketeering since 2007 raises questions why the prosecution only investigated alleged corruption after 2020.All of the Castaño Clan’s alleged local associates were elected in 2019 when the senator admittedly was already engaged in corruption.The prosecution also failed to investigate Palacios, whose office allegedly allowed Castaño to “distribute” Interior Ministry contracts.Palacios came under fire in May after the Anti-Corruption Institute revealed that the Interior Ministry had illegally granted contracts with a value of more than $1.2 billion (COP5 trillion) in violation of anti-election fraud legislation that took force in November.In an attempt to bypass the laws that seek to prevent the use of public funds for political campaigns, Duque and his congressional coalition illegally suspended that part of the “Guarantees Law” while approving the 2022 budget.This is a predominantly fraudulent congress that promoted the reform of the Guarantees Law knowing that it was unconstitutional, in order to distribute five trillion pesos in slush funds in the middle of the electoral period in agreement with the President of the Republic. This is what academics call systemic corruption.Anti-corruption Institute President Camilo EncisoColombia made $1.2B available for possible slush fundsThe Constitutional Court declared the contracts null and void, and confirmed that Duque and his congressional coalition in had illegally suspended key elements of the so-called “Guarantees Law” to bypass anti-election fraud legislationThe ruling triggered the opposition to press a flurry of criminal charges against the government coalition.With the exception of Castaño, the prosecution has yet to report progress in the investigations into Duque’s allegedly criminal coalition allies. corruptionDaniel PalaciosLiberal PartyMaria Juliana Ruiz ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-first-lady-slush-funds-and-organized-crime/,"Colombia’s first lady, slush funds and organized crime"

On this pretext, they would seek a postponement.Senator Rodrigo LaraVega’s increasingly weak positionNational Registrar Alexander Vega (Image: Twitter)The position of the national registrar has weakened considerably after the congressional elections that were marred by irregularities.W Radio reported on Wednesday that the Prosecutor General’s Office opened a classified preliminary investigation into Vega on undefined charges.The prosecution investigation followed investigations by Inspector General Margarita Cabello and the Council of State that were announced in April.Vega’s 2019 election by the presidents of the top courts was allegedly illegal and could result in a decision to revoke the result of this election.Local media reported last week that the Council of State is unlikely to rule on the legitimacy of the national registrar before the elections. 2022 electionsAlexander VegaAlvaro UribeAndres Pastrana ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-far-right-trying-to-postpone-presidential-elections/,Colombia’s far-right trying to postpone presidential elections
" The participation of Colombia’s establishment candidate Federico Gutierrez in the second round of the elections is no done deal, multiple polls suggest.Three polls that were released on Thursday showed a sharp increase in support for former Bucaramanga Mayor Rodolfo Hernandez.A poll released by CNC even suggested that the difference in support between Hernandez and Gutierrez was only 1.7 percentage points.What appears to be certain is the impending victory of opposition Senator Gustavo Petro in the first round on Sunday next week.Latest pollsThe rise of HernandezAccording to Invamer, whose poll was the most extensive, support from Hernandez went from 13.9% in April to 20.9% this week.Whether the liberal demagogue can maintain momentum is far from certain, however.All polls were held shortly after a major scandal caused by corporate television network RCN, which confronted Hernandez with an image of his daughter who was kidnapped and presumably murdered in 2004.The confrontation triggered a wave of solidarity for the candidate and fierce criticism about the questionable ethics of RCN.The polls were held before the television network revealed that Hernandez had agreed to the confrontation.Did Gutierrez hit the ceiling?All polls indicated that Gutierrez failed to significantly increase his support after winning the primary of his “Team for Colombia” coalition in March.The establishment candidate has been consistently confronted by reports about his allies’ ties to organized crime and notoriously corrupt “clans.”Gutierrez‘s opponents have additionally stressed the conservative’s association with the unpopular President Ivan Duque.All of the government’s coalition parties have expressed their support for the establishment candidate.Petro’s victory a done deal?Neither Hernandez nor Gutierrez would be anywhere near defeating Petro in the first round, according to the pollsters.The progressive candidate has been leading in the polls since the beginning of campaigning in September last year.Petro’s “Historic Pact” coalition scored a major victory in the March 13 congressional elections when the progressives obtained almost 20% of the seats in the Senate.Since then, the opposition has put its weight behind the progressive senator’s campaign.The opposition’s efforts to secure more than 50% of the votes on Sunday next week appears to have failed, meaning that Petro will have to win the June 19 second round to become president. 2022 electionselection pollsFederico GutierrezGustavo PetroRodolfo Hernandez ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-establishment-candidate-disappoints-in-election-polls/,Colombia’s establishment candidate disappoints in election polls

" The campaign of Colombia’s establishment candidate Federico Gutierrez confirmed that it received a death threat signed by  far-right group “Aguilas Negras.”According to Gutierrez’s campaign chief, Luis Felipe Henao, a pamphlet that threatened to kill Gutierrez was sent to their campaign headquarters in Bogota.Today these threats are reaching us in the urban sector, and they are reaching our campaign headquarters. They have already been reported to the Police and the Prosecutor General’s Office, and we hope to continue fighting for the country. We are confident that our alliance is with Colombians and not with criminals.Campaign chief Luis Felipe HenaoThe pamphlet signed by the Aguilas Negras threatened to kill the “terrorists disguised behind neckties, as well as the journalists at the service of the dirty war” and members of the military.It is time that the terrorists disguised in neckties, as well as the journalists in the service of the dirty war and the active military personnel know that their time has come and that we will not tolerate that one more of the murderers of our farmers reach public office with the support of the traitorous government, but there will be no one in Colombia who will allow the country to continue bleeding to death.Aguilas NegrasThe pamphlet also said that we will also not allow that [allegedly illegal interim Mayor] Juan Camilo Restrepo assumes power in Medellin” after the allegedly illegal suspension of progressive Mayor Daniel Quintero.Medellin government rejects ‘illegitimate’ interim mayorInstead of seeking a “Colombia free of communists” as usual, the pamphlet signed by the Aguilas Negras this time said to seek a “Colombia free of corruption.”The pamphlet also accused the administration of President Ivan Duque of being a “traitorous government” after years of supporting the increasingly authoritarian president and his political patron, far-right President Alvaro Uribe.Gutierrez campaign confirmed the death threat weeks after Francia Marquez, the vice-presidential candidate of frontrunner Gustavo Petro, said that she received as many as three death threats signed by the Aguilas Negras in March.Racism and misogyny mar Colombia’s election raceIn response to questions by war crimes tribunal JEP earlier this month, the prosecution reiterated that they believe that the Aguilas Negras are an actual group.Evidence indicates that some violent activity associated with the far-right group involves extremist members of the security forces.Some death threats suggest they could have been sent by individual supporters of far-right former President Alvaro Uribe, or by regional forces trying to terrorize social leaders.While the pamphlets successfully terrorize social leaders who enjoy no protection, political leaders generally respond to the pamphlets with scorn. 2022 electionsAguilas Negrasdeath threatsFederico Gutierrez ",https://colombiareports.com/far-right-group-goes-from-opposing-communism-to-corruption/,Far-right group goes from opposing communism to opposing corruption in Colombia

We want to have guarantees. Sending this message delegitimizes this process.Vice-presidential candidate Francia MarquezAmbassador echoes far-right conspiracy theoriesAccording to Marquez, Goldberg’s claims are in line with the US Government’s “geopolitical dispute” with Putin, but also echoed “stigmatizing messages and accusations that we have ties with Russia and Venezuela” promoted by the far-right.Petro’s campaign manager, Senator Roy Barreras, said that the bilateral ties between Bogota and Washington DC “are a strong point that must be managed with the upmost tact.”“The defense of democracy against eastern autocratic models unites us,” said Barreras on Twitter.The frontrunner in the elections did not respond to Goldberg, but suggested previously that the United States’ Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) was trying to interfere in the elections.The alleged attempts of the government of former US President Donald Trump to influence and discredit Colombia’s war crimes tribunal caused tensions in 2019.US conspiracy theory not newState Department officials made similar claims as Goldberg between December last year and February as Putin was preparing an invasion in Ukraine.Goldberg is the first US official to bring up the conspiracy theory after the invasion sparked a war between the two Eastern European countries, and increased tensions between Washington DC and Moscow.Far-right supporters of President Ivan Duque have been using the US claims to claim they would be the ones to “protect freedom and democracy” in Colombia against Petro.Independent electoral observers said after the congressional elections in March that they have seen “no evidence” of any foreign intervention in the electoral process. 2022 electionsdiplomacyelection fraudforeign relationsFrancia MarquezRussiaUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-opposition-rejects-us-claim-of-russian-threat/,Colombia’s opposition dismisses US claim of ‘Russian threat’
" President Ivan Duque’s drug policy of the past four years has been a failure that frustrated Colombia’s peace process, according to a study.Think tank Elementa DDHH came to these damning conclusions after monitoring drug policy initiatives since 2018 when Duque took office.Ruta FuturoThe government’s so-called “Ruta Futuro” policy sought to combat the consumption and trafficking of illicit drugs through a “integral approach” that had a budget of more than $1 billion (COP4.4 trillion).Ruta Futuro “pillars”Reduce the consumption and impact of drugsReduce the availability of drugsDismantle and affect criminal structuresAffect criminal economies and revenuePromoting legal economic activity through developmentAccording to Elementa DDHH, Duque’s drug policy basically sought to replicate “War on Drugs”-like policies that had failed before.Additionally, the drug policy’s focus on the forced eradication of coca, the base ingredient for cocaine, “went against the peace process” agreed by former President Juan Manuel Santos and now-defunct guerrilla group FARC in 2016.Drug useThe Health Ministry wouldn’t tell Elementa DDHH which indicators — if any — were used to measure the effectiveness of efforts to reduce the consumption and impact of drugs.The Colombian Drug Observatory has not investigated the prevalence of drug use and its impact on public health since 2013.Consequently, the think tank did not the know if the government’s drug policy regarding consumption had any effect.Production of drugsCoca field in Tambo, a municipality in Nariño. (Image: Kyle Johnson / International Crisis Group)The government had allocated 95% of its “Ruta Futuro” budget on efforts to reduce the availability of the drugs, and cocaine in particular.Some $341.5 million (COP1.4 trillion) was reserved for the voluntary substitution of coca, a key element of a 2016 peace deal between former President Juan Manuel Santos and now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.This program apparently was a major success as coca cultivation dropped 99.2% among the 99,097 coca-growing families who signed up in 2017.In fact, the families taking part in the PNIS program have eradicated more than 44,000 hectares.The government kicked more than 88,000 families out of the program after taking office and spent the remaining $683 million (COP2.8 trillion) budget on the security forces.Police play with one of the drones that was bought for the aerial spraying of coca. The toys turned out to be a waste of money and were never used. (Image: Caracol)According to the Defense Ministry, this strategy allowed to forced eradication of almost 390,000 hectares of coca since 2018.The total area used for the cultivation of coca decreased only 28,000 hectares between 2017 and 2020, the United Nations said last year.Estimated cocaine productionDozens of community leaders who were promoting the voluntary substitution program were assassinated.At least three people died in at least 27 clashes between farming communities who had been kicked out of the PNIS program and the security forces since 2018, according to Elementa DDHH.News magazine Cambio reported in February that the government invested another $731.8 billion (COP3 trillion) in a failed attempt to resume the aerial spraying of coca that wasn’t in the original strategy.Colombia announces aerial spraying of coca for 7th timeTaking down narcos(Image: National Police)The government’s initial drug policy was vague about its budget to dismantle drug trafficking organizations and refused to implement the part of the peace deal that sought to create public policies that would allow the dismantling of organized crime groups.Elementa DDH found a $244,000 (COP1 billion) budget “to reduce the domestic drug market” as an element of the third pillar, but was unable to find a budget to dismantle organizations involved in the international cocaine trade wasn’t clear.Nevertheless, Colombia’s Counternarcotics Police unit told the think tank that 49 organized crime groups involved in international drug trafficking were dismantled since 2018.Some 396 people were extradited on drug charges during the same period, according to the Justice Ministry.ExtraditionsThe dismantling of these organized crime groups and the extradition of alleged drug traffickers apparently has had little effect on Colombia’s cocaine exports.Meanwhile, Duque’s refusal to implement the peace deal has pushed deadly violence to levels not seen in a decade.   armed conflictDrug policydrug traffickingIvan Duquepeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-drug-policy-of-past-4-years-a-failure-study/,Colombia’s drug policy a ‘failure’ that obstructed peace: study
" Election observers said that Colombia’s congressional elections in March were more than twice as violent as those in 2018 and the most violent since 2010.In a report, the independent Electoral Observation Mission (MOE) said Tuesday that it has registered 581 acts of electoral violence in the year before March 13 when a new congress was elected.This is 109% more than during the last election cycle in 2018 and makes this year’s election cycle the most violence since 2010, according to the MOE, which has monitored elections since 2007.Electoral violence in ColombiaAccording to the MOE, deadly violence like homicides and forced disappearances remained virtually the same despite the sharp increase in general violence.The NGO registered 103 assassinations and four cases of forced disappearance with a possible electoral motive. Ahead of the 2018 election, 110 leaders were murdered and one disappeared.Types of electoral violenceWith the exception of Bogota, the violence mostly took place in relatively densely populated provinces with a long history of both political violence and organized crime.As part of the peace process, victim representatives from these provinces were allowed to run for 16 transitory seats in the House of Representatives.Regional distribution of violenceChanging causes of violenceThe MOE said that the violence was partly due to historical political violence against emerging political forces and the resumption of armed conflict in parts of the country that followed the 2017 demobilization of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.This increase in violence against leaders is also framed in a context of reconfiguration of the conflict, characterized by the consolidation of multiple illegal armed groups that have taken advantage of the vacuum left by the extinct FARC guerrilla group and the State’s inability to occupy the territories.MOE director Alejandra BarriosAccording to the MOE, illegal armed groups like guerrilla group ELN, paramilitary organization AGC and FARC dissidents were responsible for more than 31% of the violence ahead of the elections compared to less than 13% in 2018. 2022 electionsMOEpolitical violence ",https://colombiareports.com/electoral-violence-in-colombia-doubled-since-2018/,Electoral violence in Colombia doubled since 2018
" Colombia’s constitutional court legalized physician-assisted suicide (PAS) on Wednesday.The historic ruling decriminalized PAS for people who suffer from severe health conditions that patients consider a threat to their dignity.The ruling made Colombia the second country in the Americas to decriminalize PAS nationally after Canada.The practice is also allowed in some parts of the United States.The right to die with dignityThe ruling is the latest in a series to grant Colombians the right to a signified death that began with the legalization of euthanasia under specific circumstances in 1997.The court ordered Congress to regulate euthanasia, which only applies to terminally ill people, in 2014.Between 2015 and October last year, 178 people with terminal illnesses had been legally euthanized, advocacy group DesLAB told British news agency Reuters earlier this year.The Constitutional Court last year recognized that euthanasia should also be available for people whose health conditions threatened their human dignity.Since then, two people who claimed that their illnesses deprived them of their human dignity have been euthanized in Colombia.The latest ruling shields physicians who assist in the suicide of patients falling under this category from criminal prosecution and comply to strict conditions.Conditions for assisted suicidePatient must be duly diagnosed with a serious or incurable disease or bodily injuryPatient must suffer from intense physical or psychological pain that is incompatible with their idea of a dignified lifePatient must consent to assisted suicidePatient must be assisted by a medical professionalControversy remainsOne of the most important human rights is the right to life, which is why depriving anyone of that right is generally considered murder.Even if murder was legal, the vast majority of people would never take someone’s life, which especially applies to doctors and nurses who have sworn to “do no harm or injustice” for more than 2,300 years.I will do no harm or injustice to them… Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course… Into whatsoever houses I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm.Hippocratic Oath fragmentThe court agreed with human rights organization DescLab that claimed that prolonging suffering by keeping patients alive caused more harm and injustice than allowing them to commit assisted suicide.The ruling only shields medical teams who believe that assisted suicide is the ethic choice from criminal prosecution.Doctors or nurses continue to be free to refuse to carry out the fatal procedure if they believe this would violate their personal ethics.

" Colombia’s inspector general said she provisionally suspended the mayors of Medellin and Ibague for their alleged meddling in elections.Inspector General Margarita Cabello announced the suspensions on Twitter, but didn’t immediately publish formal disciplinary charges.The decision is controversial as it could be in violation of international law, which bars the inspector general from removing elected officials from office without a court order.Furthermore, Cabello was criticized for suspending Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero just hours after a video in which Quintero called for a “change in the first,” apparently referring to a single-round election victory for opposition candidate Gustavo Petro on May 29.Cabello announced no measures against General Eduardo Zapateiro, who is being investigated by the inspector general’s office for his public opposition to Petro.Perhaps most importantly, the inspector general claimed to have the powers to remove elected officials from office, which Cabello only does if she decides to blatantly violate international law.The announced suspensions were rejected by opposition politicians.Legal experts argued Cabello may be breaking the law herself.Others criticized the inspector general’s apparent double standard when it comes to using her authority.“The institutionality of watchdog entities is being destroyed,” presidential candidate Sergio Fajardo said.The suspensions are the latest escalation of tensions over the March congressional election and the ongoing presidential race.According to the independent Electoral Observation Mission (MOE), public confidence in electoral authorities plummeted after the National Registry failed to count some 1.5 million opposition votes in the congressional election.The MOE has also called on President Ivan Duque to stop interfering in election debates.The Constitutional Court last week struck down elements of the 2022 budget that suspended electoral legislation against illegal campaign financing.Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party suffered a major defeat in the congressional elections and polls indicate that Petro is likely to defeat the establishment in the presidential elections. 2022 electionsAntioquiaDaniel QuinteroInspector General's OfficeMargarita CabelloMedellinTolima ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-inspector-general-suspends-mayors-on-election-meddling-charges/,Colombia’s inspector general suspends mayors on election meddling charges

This is what academics call systemic corruption.Anti-corruption Institute President Camilo EncisoCourt strikes back hardThe Constitutional Court struck down the illegal suspension, which legal experts and opposition politicians had expected for months.What nobody could expect was that the court also declared every contracts granted after the illegal amendment of the Guarantees Law null and void.To make it even worse, the court ordered the government to recover every penny given as an advance to the private contractors.Only private contractors and municipal governments that can prove they have completed the projects agreed with the government will be left off the hook.All other illegally transferred funds must be returned, which would be a major problem for those who spent the money on illegal campaigning ahead of the March 13 congressional elections.Former government accountability chief Juan Gabriel Duque told Noticias Uno that the ruling would also mean trouble for those who haven’t finished projects they started with the illegal funds.Colombia’s top illegal spendersInterior Minister Daniel PalaciosThe security forces were the biggest spenders of illegal funds, granting three contracts worth a total $232 million (COP940 billion) on what could be slush funds.The military was followed by Interior Minister Daniel Palacios, who last week promised the mayors of 17 municipalities $308,000 (COP1.3 billion) each, allegedly for parks that would improve public security.If the ministry has already transferred the funds, the mayors will simply have to send back the money.Illegal spending per entityThe court could have sunk the unconstitutional articles in February already, had it not been for Inspector General Margarita Cabello, who didn’t surrender her opinion until recently.Cabello is Duque’s former justice minister and has become increasingly controversial over her repeated failures to do her job as inspector general.Opposition announces fraud chargesOpposition lawmakers who tried to prevent the illegal suspension of electoral guarantees last year were silenced by House of Representatives President Jennifer Arias who simply turned off their microphones during the budget debate.Now that the court confirmed that Arias and her fellow lawmakers had illegally amended the Guarantees Law, these lawmakers announced legal actions, including fraud charges.Opposition candidates in the presidential elections said that the coalition’s alleged criminal conspiracy sought to financially benefit the campaign of the runner up in the election race, former Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez.The establishment candidate is being endorsed by the same coalition parties that suspended the electoral guarantees.The slush fund scandal is the biggest election fraud scandal since 2005 when the government of former President Alvaro Uribe bribed congressmen to change the constitution in order to allow Duque’s political patron to run for a second term. 2022 electionselection fraudGuarantees LawPresident Ivan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-made-1-2b-available-for-possible-slush-funds/,Colombia made $1.2B available for possible slush funds

" State authorities have been unable to provide basic services in Arauca, a province in the northeast of Colombia that has lived under guerrilla rule for years.The province on the border with Venezuela has been submerged in violence after dissident FARC guerrillas began disputing the control of guerrilla group ELN on January 1.The subsequent state collapse became painfully visible on Monday when municipal ombudsmen from Arauca took to social media to demand that authorities pick up the remains of two adults and two children who were murdered in a massacre.According to think tank Indepaz, the massacre in Tame was the second this year. Authorities have no idea how many people were killed in the first massacre that allegedly left at least 27 people dead on the first two days of the year.In fact, national authorities don’t seem to how many lives were lost in the most recent war on Arauca.According to the National Police database, 88 people have been murdered in Arauca so far this year. The prosecution has registered 136 victims.The war has displaced more than 3,860 people so far this year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report that was published in late March.The NGO blasted the government’s lack of response and its attempts to make the humanitarian crisis invisible.The Colombian government has given a poor response and seems more interested in making the situation there invisible than in assisting and protecting these people.Human Rights Watch analyst Juan PappierDefense Minister Diego Molano responded by promoting the alleged progress of the government’s “Arauca Stabilization Plan.”Our National Army protects the civilian population on the border and uses technology to do so, while guaranteeing sovereignty and preventing terrorist acts by armed groups such as the ELN and FARC dissidents.Defense Minister Diego MolanoMonday’s massacre highlighted how the government of President Ivan Duque was blowing smoke.

" Colombia’s establishment candidate is receiving support from President Ivan Duque’s coalition partners and pseudo-legal “clans.”Runner up Federico Gutierrez became the most viable candidate to confront the anti-corruption candidates after winning the coalition of the “Team for Colombia” primary in March.Following that victory, the former Medellin Mayor received the support of his rivals in the primary, Conservative Party Senator David Barguil and former Barranquilla Mayor Alejandro Char.Duque’s coalition partners rally behind “Fico”Federico Gutierrez and his Conservative Party allies.

(Image: Twitter)A campaign event in the Caribbean city of Barranquilla last week indicated that Gutierrez may also be able to count on a large number of “clans” from that region, according to political news website La Silla Vacia.Among those attending the meeting that was hosted by Char Clan patriarch Fuad Char, were multiple clans that have historically dominated the elections in the Caribbean region, not always without the use of fraud.The Char Clan has almost absolute power in Barranquilla and the surrounding Atlantico province.Barguil and his party, who were also present, move a lot of votes in Cordoba and La Guajira.Among those invited were the families of convicted former Atlantico Senator Eduardo Pulgar, the adopted daughter of convicted former Senator Vicente Biel from Bolivar and Representative Karen Cure, the heir of jailed mafia boss Enlice Lopez from Sucre, according to La Silla Vacia.The clan of convicted former Senator William Montes from Bolivar has reportedly also expressed its support for Gutierrez .This gives Gutierrez significant support from the traditional parties and the electoral barons in the Caribbean region.Media supportColombia’s corporate media have openly been promoting the Gutierrez campaign while discrediting his rivals.Weekly Semana, which is run by a member of the Gnecco crime family from Cesar, went as far as calling Gutierrez  “a candidate of the people”  and urging the frontrunner in the election race, progressive candidate Gustavo Petro, that it was “enough already.”Semana features on Gutierrez and PetroDespite the abundant free press, imagines from Gutierrez’ campaign indicate that the establishment candidate has barely been able to attract people to his rallies.No more than a few dozen people showed up at Gutierrez most recent campaign rally.The problem with the corporate media that are actively campaigning for Gutierrez is that they have been losing audiences and public approval for years.Media approvalNerves about criminal investigations?Gutierrez’s bigest impediment may be that  ore buyers and jurors working for the clans may be hesitant to commit voter fraud amid ongoing criminal investigations into irregularities in the March congressional elections and alleged attempts to rig the elections in 2018.This may make it difficult for Fico and his patrons to eject liberal candidates Rodolfo Hernandez and Sergio Fajardo in the first round of the elections on May 29.Defeating Petro in a possible second round in June may even be impossible. 2022 electionsFederico Gutierrez ",https://colombiareports.com/the-shady-forces-behind-the-campaign-of-colombias-establishment-candidate/,The shady forces behind the campaign of Colombia’s establishment candidate

" The former commander of Colombia’s armed forces allegedly helped paramilitary organization AGC control the drug trade in  the southwest of the country, according to radio station Blu.The radio station made the claim based on a 663-page prosecution report in which retired General Leonardo Barrero was accused of helping “Matamba.”This drug trafficker of “La Cordillera,” a drug trafficking organization that is part of the AGC, allegedly took over the drug trade in the southwestern Nariño province with the help of the military.Barrero, a.k.a. “The Godfather,” allegedly mediated military support for Matamba at east between September 2019 until early this year, according to the radio station.This implies that the former armed forces commander was involved in drug trafficking while running for governor in the Cauca province for President Ivan Duque’s Democratic Center party.Before that, Barrero was in charge of Duque’s program to protect human rights defenders and community leaders.The president gave the retired general the important position after Barrero’s failed attempt to enter the Senate for the Conservative Party.The general was the commander of the armed forces between 2013 and 2014, and was sacked over widespread corruption and his alleged obstruction of investigations into extrajudicial executions.While running for governor in Cauca, Barrero allegedly helped Matamba do away with illegal armed groups vying for control over the drug trade in Nariño.Jailed former colonel Colonel Robinson Gonzalez mediated between Matamba and “The Godfather,” according to wiretapped conversations between the two.In the conversation, Gonzalez told Matamba that “The Godfather” would pressure military intelligence to target “Sabalo,” a dissident commander of the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC in Nariño.The province in southwest Colombia is home to some of the country’s most extensive coca fields and major drug trafficking routes to the Pacific coast.The revelation that linked Barrero to drug traffickers comes a day after the commander of the 6th Division was sacked over his admitted ties to drug traffickers.

Those cameras, operated by members of the National Police, are the ones that make it difficult for him to tell the whole truth. Especially because his testimony will implicate members of the security forces.W RadioAccording to DIJIN, the hearing was suspended because the location where Otoniel is being held had “irresponsibly” been described.This constituted a breach of the “entry and security protocols” and spurred the suspension, according to the police intelligence unit.The police revealed that the former AGC chief was being detained in the DIJIN’s headquarters and published an image of Otoniel’s cell in November last year.“Otoniel,” the most wanted drug trafficker in the world in recent years, was transferred from the DIJIN’s jail to the main headquarters.National PoliceIn a press release, the Truth Commission said that it had respected all security protocols and that the police “should allow this person to give a free and voluntary account.”The Commission insists that this interview is based on the right of Colombian society to know the truth about what happened in the armed conflict and we hope that this process initiated with Dairo Úsuga David, who was involved in the armed conflict for 35 years and linked to various illegal armed groups, will end satisfactorily.Truth CommissionThe police did not respond to its reported failure to facilitate confidential meetings between Otoniel, his attorneys, the Truth Commission and the war crimes tribunal.

" Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez broke out crying on Monday during the presentation of a report on a police massacre in Colombia’s capital last year.According to the report, police were responsible for 11 of the 14 murders that were committed during the Bogota Massacre in September last year.Also the lead investigator of the Bogota Massacre, former Ombudsman Carlos Negret, was unable to hold back his tears while presenting his findings.Former Ombudsman Carlos Negret cries while expressing gratitude to the families of victims of the police massacre.The Bogota MassacrePolice and civilians supporting the authorities murdered 13 citizens and one immigrant in an apparent attempt to quell an uprising that was triggered by the brutal murder of a Bogota resident on September 9.Between September 9 and September 11 last year, more than 300 residents and more than 100 cops in were injured, according to the report. More than 70 police posts were destroyed in Bogota and the neighboring city of Soacha .The violence primarily targeted poor residents and low-ranking police officers, according to the former ombudsman.Negret confirmed the accounts of victims who have said that police have terrorized Bogota residents in an apparent attempt to corrupt justice.The security forces criminalize poverty, which leads to authoritarian and illegal actions against inhabitants of certain social sectors.Report on Bogota MassacreNegret called for a “serious peace and reconciliation process between the National Police and citizens” and effective criminal investigations into the massacre in order to prevent repetition.According to the report, only 11 people were indicted after the prosecution opened criminal investigations against more than 900 police officersThe judicial failures are due to the alleged prosecution’s failure to timely inspect the crime scenes of the murders committed during the massacre, the report said.Additionally, the prosecution replaced investigators on multiple occasions and witnesses of the police killings have been terrorized and threatened by cops.The United Nations’ human rights chief in Colombia, Juliette Riveros, said that the report confirmed the necessity for a reform of the National Police.Riveros additionally called on the prosecution to investigate the massacre and punish those responsible in order to restore public confidence in the police.

" Colombia’s House of Representatives on Monday approved legislation that allows government officials to request the shut-down of news media that report on them.The controversial rider was part of an “anti-corruption” bill that was sponsored by coalition party Radical Change and has yet to be approved by the Senate.The vote triggered a storm of protest of free speech advocates who claimed that the bill sought to censor journalists who report on government corruption.In response to the blowback, Congress amended the article, which initially allowed government official to request an arraignment judge to jail critics charged with slander or defamation.When the person who defames or slanders a public servant or former public servant is a legal representative or member of any community organization and uses it to commit the crime, the arraignment judge shall order the competent authority to proceed to the suspension or cancellation of the legal entity of the community organization to which it belongs, upon the request of the prosecutor or the victim and in compliance with the legal requirements established for this.Proposed article 221A of Colombia’s criminal codeDespite the change, press freedom organization FLIP said that the pending amendment of the criminal code introduced “a decidedly backwards norm against the freedom of the press, the freedom of expression and the right to information of Colombians.”The support of 73 representatives for the imposition of these disproportionate and chastening measures against the press, contrary to all warnings of their censorious effect, reveals a legislature that rejects citizen oversight and instead wields power for the purpose of intimidation, an ominous message for the freedom of expression.FLIPThe Colombian branch of Transparency International said that the possible approval of the bill in the senate “would be a setback for the fight against corruption” as it “generates disincentives to reporting and puts at risk the freedom of expression.”Electoral observers joined the free speech advocates and rejected the proposed amendment of the criminal code that “restricts the oversight of citizens.”It is not the Congress of the Republic that should indicate the tone and content of what people talk about.

" Colombia’s Senate president pressed criminal charges against two journalists, claiming that their evidence indicating that he is a crook is affecting his reputation.Few dispute that investigative journalist website Cuestion Publica reputation of Senator Juan Diego Gomez (Conservative Party) was all but destroyed.The website revealed the Conservative Party’s alleged ties to all kinds of organized crime figures and alleged criminal practices since 1981 after all.Whether this is the journalist’s problem begs the question as the senator got into business with the family of a fraudster, a money launderer and drug traffickers.The journalists merely published the evidence indicating how Gomez maintained ties to organized crime figures, including the cousin of former President Alvaro Uribe, in his native Antioquia province for decades.The senate president may feel a little uncomfortable as he could be facing a considerably longer prison sentence than his father, Orlando Gomez, who died in 2013 while serving an eight-years prison sentence for fraud.The innocent little GomezGomez was born in 1975 in the town of El Santuario where his uncle, Pedro Antonio Jimenez, was a powerful politician.The political heir began expanding his political power in 1997 when the 22-year-old successfully campaigned for the Senate obtaining most of his votes from his uncle’s base.Gomez left the Senate and ran for a seat in the Antioquia Assembly in 2005 after which the deputy expanded his regional empire with alleged drug trafficking associate Diego Aristazabal Meija by buying real estate in Copacabana.The politician’s business partner was put on the US Treasury’s Kingpin List in 2010 because Mejia had been a former Medellin Cartel pilot and was accused of being an associate of Sinaloa Cartel boss “El Chapo” Guzman.Mejia was well connected in Antioquia though. Back in 1981, the alleged narco associate had done business with Carlos Gaviria, the cousin of late drug lord Pablo Escobar, and Luis Carlos Molina, who would later be convicted for financing the assassination of legendary newspaper owner Guillermo Cano.Despite being flagged by the US Government, the alleged narco associate continued doing business with the deputy director of another major shareholder in the Copacabana project, Estrategias Financieras SA.The drug trafficking problem of Colombia’s CongressReturn to CongressMeanwhile, Gomez successfully returned to Congress in 2010.One of the contributors to the conservative politician’s campaign, Cesar Augusto Hernandez, began laundering bribes for Brazilian engineering firm Odebrecht, according to newspaper El Tiempo.A year later, Gomez’s business partners Maria Consuelo Ruiz got in trouble when the Supreme Court found she had a $3.8 million deal with two convicted senators, Otto Bula and Mario Uribe, the cousin of former President Alvaro Uribe.Between 2012 and 2013, the conservative politician met privately met with former Odebrecht Colombia CEO Eleuberto Martorelli, which was “entirely social,” Gomez said a day after Hernandez was detained in2017 as the bribery scandal unfolded.Another business partner of the Congressman, Luis Fernando Begue, would end up managing the finances of Uribe’s newly founded Democratic Center party in 2014.Between 2017 and 2019, Gomez’s wife Elizabeth Zapata funneled all kinds of government funds from the office of former Antioquia Governor Luis Perez to a company called Valor+, political analyst Ariel Avila said in 2019.This company was in charge of formalizing land ownership and the registry of land in areas that had been ravaged by war in Antioquia, according to Avila.Between 2011 and 2020, campaigned donors and political aides of Gomez signed as many as 106 contracts with a total value of almost $2 million, according to the Electronic System for Public Contracts. Two thirds of these contracts were granted without any public bidding found Cuestion Publica.The senator would own two apartments in Medellin, and flipped another two plus a plot of land in the city before becoming congressman in 2010, according to the investigative journalism website.Gomez has three pending investigations against him, not counting a lawsuit demanding his impeachment and a criminal investigation over alleged his alleged complicity in crimes committed by his convicted former business partners.Despite multiple  civilian courts ruling that “we do not see how the information” released by Cuestion Publica “is biased or incorrect, and much less false,” the senate president insists he is an honorable man.With the help of Jesus Albeiro Yepes, a lawyer of the notorious Uribe family, Gomez pressed criminal charges against the investigative journalists presumably in the hope that this will save his reputation. corruptionJuan Diego Gomezjudicial harassment ",https://colombiareports.com/is-publishing-evidence-indicating-colombias-senate-is-run-by-a-crook-a-crime/,Is publishing evidence indicating Colombia’s senate is run by a crook a crime?
" Colombia’s leading opposition forces found themselves in trouble on Tuesday over their leaders’ alleged negligence and talks with a war crimes apologist.Presidential candidate Sergio Fajardo of the newly formed “Center Hope Coalition” requested protection from the Organization of American States (OAS) in response to a negligence conviction that barred him for holding public office.The “Historic Pact” led by progressive Senator Gustavo Petro came under fire for talks with former Medellin Mayor Luis Perez, a war crimes apologist.Moderates team up ahead of Colombia’s 2022 electionsFajardo’s controversial convictionFajardo announced that he would seek protection from the OAS’ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) over the alleged political persecution by the government of President Ivan Duque.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, a close friend of the president, announced a criminal investigation against the moderate candidate in March.Comptroller General Carlos Felipe Henao, a close friend of the chief prosecutor, rejected Fajardo’s appeal against a negligence conviction last month.The decision effectively barred Fajardo from holding public office after Duque’s congressional coalition voted to add political sanctions to administrative convictions in violation of international law in June.According to journalist Maria Jimena Duzan, the moderate candidate and Falardo’s progressive candidate have been on a prosecution list that sought “to screw with the opposition” since the 2018 elections.Presidential candidate found responsible for Colombia’s $1.1B dam debaclePetro’s controversial new associatePetro came under fire on Tuesday after his coalition released images of a meeting with former Medellin Mayor Luis Perez.The Antioquia power monger is controversial for his apologies for war crimes committed in Colombia’s second largest city.Perez added fuel to the fire by telling newspaper El Espectador that he was “happy” with “Operation Orion,” a 2002 military operation in Medellin that has designated a crime against humanity by the Inter-American Human Rights Court.Senator Inti Asprilla said that “we didn’t have an internal fight inside the Green Alliance [party] for this.”Petro insisted on maintaining talks with the dissident Liberal Party mogul about Perez’s possible electoral support for the opposition. 2022 electionsGustavo Petroluis perezpolitical persecutionsergio fajardo ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-opposition-in-trouble-over-negligence-war-crimes-apologist/,"Colombia’s opposition in trouble over negligence, war crimes apologist"

Twitter as the country’s least reliable news people.#1 – Vicky Davila (Semana)Vicky Davila (Still: YouTube)The unchallenged queen of media dishonesty is Vicky Davila, the director of weekly Semana and a member of the crime family founded by legendary bank robber Lucas Gnecco in the 1970’s.Davila has long been a loyal supporter of former President Alvaro Uribe, the only former Medellin Cartel associate in history who was awarded a Medal Freedom.The piling criminal investigations that ended Uribe’s career may have saved Davila’s career, at least the Gnecco Crime Family member runs Semana into the ground.Until then, Davila appears to be motivated to counter every revelation of corruption in Colombia with absurd conspiracy theories, hilarious fearmongering and countless spelling

active opponents of democracy.The television network hired the lawyer as news chief earlier this year, just in time to lead one of the most blatant disinformation campaigns that criminalized citizens who protested against the government of President Ivan Duque.Under Acevedo’s leadership, RCN has largely ignored reports on extreme police brutality that allegedly killed some 80 protesters and

" Political violence ahead of Colombia’s elections has surged, particularly in regions where some historically have considered democracy a potential threat to their personal interests.The Electoral Observation Mission (MOE) said in its latest report that it had registered 304 acts of political violence since March 13, the beginning of the electoral year.This would be a 125% increase compared to the 135 acts of aggression against aspiring politicians, community leaders and rights defenders registered in the same period in 2017.Social leaders, who generally enjoy popular support over their promotion of a social cause, were the victim of more than half of the aggression followed by politicians and community representatives.Victims of political violenceAlmost half of the 58 political assassinations and more than half of the 41 attempted assassinations since March targeted social leaders, who generally find themselves in opposition against powerful interests as they defend the rights of, for example, ethnic minorities, victims and workers.The number of assassinations of these leaders increased almost 30% compared to the same period in 2017. Attempted assassinations surged more than 95%.The type of aggression that generated most victims were death threats, which surged a staggering 193%, mainly because of far-right group Aguilas Negras.Over the past seven months, the MOE registered surges in death threats in the weeks before important electoral events like, for example, the registration of primary candidates.The electoral observers warned that these threats could end up in deadly violence in the weeks before political parties’ primaries in December.Nature of the threatsWhile the majority of politically motivated death threats targeted leaders identified as “leftist” by their aggressors, much of the violence appears to associated with power instead of ideology.Most of the political leaders who suffered violence were members of the government coalition of President Ivan Duque, for example.This may indicate that the violence is mainly horizontal, and targets those trying to challenge those in the higher echelons of power rather than those who would be of a different party.According to a second think tank, Paz y Reconciliacion, the power accumulated by party members of President Ivan Duque’s coalition adds an entirely criminal element to tensions within parties that could turn violent.According to Paz y Reconciliacion, 90% of the 127 primary candidates with alleged mafia ties are from the government coalition.These candidates’ aspirations to either grab or maintain power could easily motivate violence without any ideological motive.Dodgy primary candidatesThe oppression in Colombia’s southwestThe violence was most prominent in the southwest of Colombia where there has long been an ethnic conflict between indigenous communities and the descendants of slaves that are disputing the ownership of land of the families of former slave and plantation owners.Regional distribution of threatsSocial violence in this part of Colombia has been a constant for decades and easily becomes political in an election year.Growing disapproval of Duque’s far-right regime and the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic add to instability as voters of all shapes and sizes have demanded change, causing tensions with those who are happy with how things are. 2022 electionspolitical violence ",https://colombiareports.com/political-violence-in-colombia-more-than-doubles-ahead-of-elections/,Political violence in Colombia more than doubles ahead of elections

" President Ivan Duque stepped in on Tuesday to put out a diplomatic fire that was set by his defense minister who declared Iran an “enemy” of Colombia.Duque corrected Defense Minister Diego Molano who said on a visit to Israel that Iran was “a common enemy” of the two governments despite the 12,000 kilometers between Tehran and Bogota.The presence of Lebanese armed group “Hezbollah” in Venezuela would additionally pose a threat to Colombia, the defense minister claimed.Molano was fiercely criticized at home where lawmakers demanded a retraction to prevent a deterioration of almost 50 years of diplomatic relations with the middle-eastern country.The recklessness of the Minister of Defense declaring Iran an enemy of Colombia is not trivial, it is extremely serious.Coalition congressman Jose Daniel Lopez (Radical Change)Legal experts warned the government that the minister could be charged with diplomatic treason and be sent to prison for more than six years if Molano kept running his mouth like that.Whoever is entrusted by the Colombian Government to manage a State matter with a foreign government or with a person or group of another country or with an international organization, acts to the detriment of the interests of the Republic, shall incur a prison term of eighty (80) to two hundred and seventy (270) months.Colombia’s criminal codeDuque, who initially hesitated to rectify his defense minister, later implied the minister did not speak on behalf of the government and stressed that no country is Colombia’s enemy.Colombia doesn’t use the word enemy to refer to any country.President Ivan DuqueThe president added that his government may have “differences with some nations,” but also that “Colombia has diplomatic relations with Iran” Duque apparently wanted to maintain.The defense minister, who has no experience with foreign affair, avoided referring to his first diplomatic gaffe and returned to talking nonsense about domestic issues.A satirical poll held by comedian Rafael Noguera indicated that 43% of Colombians weren’t able to pinpoint Iran on a map without consulting Google. defense ministryDiego MolanodiplomacyForeign Affairsiranmiddle east ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-defense-minister-adds-fuel-to-fire-in-middle-east/,Colombia’s defense minister adds fuel to fire in Middle East
" Colombia’s defense minister Diego Molano is under fire over evidence indicating that the regime of far-right President Ivan Duque has all but turned the country into a police state.Press freedom foundation FLIP revealed evidence on Friday that showed how the security forces faked a cyber attack and a fictional “digital terrorism” threat to justify censoring criticism and criminalizing protest.Digital privacy organization Karisma lodged a formal complaint about the cyber surveillance before the human rights commission of the Organization of American States (OAS) on Thursday.According to FLIP, the National Police’s cyber crime unit has been spying on ordinary citizens in response to anti-government protests that kicked off in April.The press freedom foundation revealed that Molano hired a PR company to help the government and “sympathetic journalists” fake a cyber attack on the security forces.Molano used this fake attack to give the police extraordinary powers to allegedly combat the publication of “fake news” and “cyber terrorism” on social media.In reality, the police tried to censor online reporting on the brutal repression of the protests and criminalize government critics, independent journalists and political activists.Colombia turns on media amid barrage of lies and propagandaThe fake cyber attack(Screenshot of the May 6 disinformation campaign)The cyber surveillance and the persecution of government critics followed the May 6 PR hoax and a subsequent campaign that deemed reports on police brutality as “cyberterrorism,” FLIP reported Friday.The defense ministry paid PR firm Alotropico SAS almost $250,000 (COP900 million) to come up with the propaganda strategy that was executed by Molano and the security forces.Creative actionsDress up the social media and digital channels of the entire public force, entities assigned to the second and spokespersons with a black “attempted block” between 0500 until 0900 with a classified character.Provoke / motivate attention of the news media, citizens and the international community so they ask: “What is going on?”Last message on all social media, websites will be attempted block.0900 all forces will together and as a team publish one video that tells the truth.We will position ourselves on social media with pieces and videos with #ColombiaEsMiVerdadFacilitate support from sympathetic journalist, also seek the attention of the international community.Defense MinistryBetween 5AM and 9AM, defense ministry and military websites showed a header that said “attempted block.”Spokespersons were not allowed not to speak to the press in order to strengthen the impression that the security forces were under attack.At the end of the fake attack, the defense ministry and the security forces published a video, which claimed that “they tried to block us but we continue to stand, protecting Colombians.”Molano and the commanders of the security forces made all kinds of false or misleading claims in the video that claimed that spreading information deemed false by the police constituted “digital terrorism.”While street cops and far-right government supporters were killing protesters, the National Police cybersecurity unit that is supposed to combat online crimes began a “hyper surveillance” that targeted critics online, according to FLIP.Killed protesters during protests’ first three monthsGovernment-loyal media replicated the fake cyber attack claims and a series of conspiracy theories that sought to criminalize peaceful protesters and conceal the extreme violence used by the police and far-right government supporters to quell the protests.Like Alotropico’s previous attempt to boost Duque’s abysmal approval rating, the firm’s latest strategy also failed as public support for corporate media plummeted and pressure to end the state terror surged.Colombia turns on media amid barrage of lies and propagandaThe cyber police stateDaily report from cyber surveillance unit PMU-CiberPMU-Ciber receives information from intelligence agency DNI, the military, the Communications Ministry, the National Registry, the National Electoral Council, and support from international police organizations like Interpol and Europol to fight cyber crime like child pornography and phishing.During the protests, the online surveillance unit began “patrolling” social media to allegedly combat “fake news in the framework of the national strike.”PMU-Ciber fed information to fact-checking websites like ColombiaCheck and La Silla Vacia to censor social media reports on police brutality and criminalize “fake” publications that would “incite violence,” according to the governmentThe online surveillance unit’s commander, Colonel Julian Buitrago, said in September that 187 people have been arrested as a result of PMU-Ciber investigations so far this year.La lucha contra el ciberdelito ya registra 187 capturas en 2021, 39 de estas han sido por abuso sexual a través de internet.

Neither what personal or sensitive information they keep and transfer, nor what is the procedure they carry out to identify and verify the contents that end up being input for criminal or disciplinary investigations.Press freedom foundation FLIPKarisma told the OAS’ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that the activities of the PMU-Ciber lacked any legal justification and checks and balances that would prevent abuse.This implies surveillance activity aimed at profiling with a differentiated impact on journalists and human rights defenders, which additionally generates a dangerous categorization of information and critical opinions that affects non-official positions. We emphasize that this is especially worrisome given the situation of systematic illegal surveillance in the country, which is rooted in illegitimate and illegal surveillance practices by the armed forces.Digital rights NGO KarismaThe digital rights organization expressed explicit concern that the activities of PMU-Ciber posed a particular threat to journalists and human rights defenders, according to the digital rights group.Colombia Reports’ Facebook page was unpublished on May 4.Furthermore, Karisma told the IACHR, the online surveillance unit would have the ability to intercept ordinary people’s private conversations on social media without a warrant.The prosecution’s Organized Crime Unit chief Javier Enrique Garcia got personally involved in the prosecution of protesters who reported alleged police brutality on social media.Garcia’s elite unit receives international funding to combat drug trafficking, but began issuing arrest warrants for citizen reporters and other protesters on terrorism charges.Colombia’s citizen reporters: ‘you have the right to remain silent’Baseless accusations and trumped up chargesDefense Minister Diego Molano visits the PMU-Ciber unit. (Image: Defense Minister)Police have arrested more than 196 people since the beginning of the protests, the defense minister said earlier this month.Molano and General Jorge Luis Vargas of the National Police have been coining all kinds of conspiracy theories to justify cracking down on protests since before they began.There is information on social media of many attacks and mobilizations, from Russia, from Venezuela and, in fact, of all the fake accounts we have found, for example, some are in Bangladesh, in Mexico, in Venezuela. And in others, hashtag movements like “they are killing us”. Here we also face a huge challenge.Defense Minister Diego MolanoVirtually all detained protesters have been released because prosecutors haven’t been able to produce any evidence of crimes or Molano’s conspiracy theories.This is partly due to the fact that there is no law against “digital terrorism” or other nonsense invented by PR firms.Reporting on facts that allow people to conclude that Colombia’s defense minister is a total idiot is also super legal.

" Colombia’s high level of inequality “is a core constraint to economic growth and social progress” in the South American country, according to the World Bank.In a report, the international financial institution said that Colombia had the second highest level of income inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean after Brazil in 2018.The richest 10 percent of Colombians earned more than 11 times the income of the poorest 10 percent.World BankAccording to the World Bank estimates from before the Covid-19 pandemic, Colombia’s richest 20% earned more than half of all income made in 2019.Colombia’s wealth gapThe economic shock caused by the pandemic “has increased inequality further,” said the World Bank, and pulled “3.6 million more people into poverty.”Born unequalIncome inequality is even more extreme between men and woman, according to the report, which claimed that “a woman in Colombia is 1.7 times more likely to be unemployed than a man.”The lack of social mobility in Colombia additionally increases the chances that children are unable to escape the poverty of their parents more in many other parts of the world.Among a group of 75 countries, the transfer of income gap from one generation to the next in Colombia is the most entrenched.World BankThe effects of inequality are a major influence on a person’s happiness, the World Bank stressed.Strikingly, inequality in Colombia extends beyond the material aspects of one’s livelihood. Less-educated Colombians, rural residents, and those who are unemployed or poor are much less likely to consider themselves to be happy.World BankTackling inequality “makes good economic sense”The international bank stressed the importance of reducing inequality in Colombia, claiming that “a more equal society would mean better lives for all.”In its report, the World Bank contradicted the former director of Colombia’s banking association, Santiago Castro, who said last month that closing the wealth gap was “the favorite banner of our Latin American populists.”It becomes the favorite banner of our Latin American populists, obsessed with equality. Equality that always eludes them, because usually to try to achieve it, they have to trample on economic and democratic freedoms. And when they come to power, what they get is a crushing impoverishment of almost all citizens.Former banking association president Santiago CastroReducing inequalities is not only an objective in itself on moral grounds, but it also makes good economic sense. Tackling inequities can lead to a better prepared, greater skilled, and more productive labor force, stronger and more sustainable economic growth, and tighter social cohesion.World BankClosing gender gaps alone “would increase Colombia’s GDP per capita by an estimated 14 percent by 2050,” according to the World Bank.In order to close the wealth gap and promote economic growth, the international financial institution urged immediate policies that would increase Colombians’ access to child care and education.Additionally, the World Bank urged an expansion of social programs to decrease poverty. povertyWorld Bank ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-wealth-gap-bogging-down-economic-growth-and-progress-world-bank/,Colombia’s wealth gap bogging down economic growth and progress: World Bank
" Following the arrest of “Otoniel,” the central command of paramilitary group AGC, a.k.a. “Clan del Golfo,” will have to choose a new leader.How this process works is unknown as the paramilitaries haven’t replaced a supreme commander since the arrest of the group’s founder, “Don Mario,” in 2009.Conflict analyst Camilo Gonzalez said that a conflict within the AGC is almost certain as multiple commanders would be ready to step up.There will be a whole succession of major conflicts, as there are other important tactical commanders such as “Chiquito Malo” and another one called “Chiapos.”Conflict analyst Camilo GonzalezAccording to analyst Ariel Avila, the possible internal conflict would change little in areas under paramilitary control.Inside the Clan del Golfo there are five central structures and another 51 regional commands, and each regional command with its own army. So, arresting someone or killing someone  — this is an important blow, but it doesn’t change much to the business.Conflict analyst Ariel AvilaParamilitary retaliationsConflict analyst Esteban Salazar warned for additional retaliatory violence targeting the security forces and civilians in areas where the AGC exercises territorial control or has major economic interests.This would mainly affect the Choco, Antioquia and Cordoba provinces where the AGC is most powerful, said Salazar.AGC activity in 2020, according to Indepaz.Authorities in the Uraba region, the paramilitaries’ stomping ground, canceled two public events on Sunday out of fear of paramilitary attacks.The independent analysts dismissed claims by President Ivan Duque and the director of the National Police, General Jorge Luis Vargas, that the arrest would imply the end of the AGC.It’s no secret that “Otoniel” had been seeking to hand himself in for a long time. The AGC/Clan del Golfo haven’t relied on his leadership for a while. They are perfectly capable of continuing without him.

" Colombia’s top election official is under fire after telling opposition politicians not to run if they felt next year’s elections wouldn’t be free and fair.Opposition candidates rejected the comments of National Registrar Alexander Vega that followed growing concerns about political persecution and election fraud.In a press conference, Vega said Tuesday that anyone who doubted the integrity of the National Registry should simply not run for office.I am going to start with a clear statement as registrar. Regarding the cloak of doubts about electoral fraud; anyone who does not feel they have guarantees, or believes that fraud is going to be committed, should not run for office.National Registrar Alexander VegaThe national registrar called the press conference in response to criticism over Vega’s claims that Colombia’s statistics agency DANE had deflated the size of population.According to the top election official, the National Registry had 5 million more Colombians in its database than the 50 million estimated by the statistics agency.DANE director Juan Diego Oviedo responded that the DANE’s estimate was more than 51 million and didn’t include Colombians living abroad.Anti-corruption activist Catherine Juvinao said that Vega’s latest comments “should activate all the public’s alarms and alerts about what kind of public official is in charge of the electoral processes in 2022.”Former Vice-President Humberto de la Calle called the national registrar’s comment “misguided.”Since my time as Registrar I have not heard such a misguided statement as that of mister Vega. His obligation is to give assurances to all, including skeptics.Former Vice-President Humberto de la CalleColombia’s top election chief has been at the center of controversy ever since Vega sacked 1,500 election officials after taking office in 2019.Last year, Duque more than doubled the budget of the National Registry and sought absolute control over the organization of the congressional and presidential elections.Colombia seeking presidential powers to meddle with electionsVega has since been allocating funds to governors of whom at least two have been detained on corruption charges.Jailed Governor Luis Alberto Monsalve received $1.2 billion “to contribute to the strengthening of democracy and the processes executed by the National Registry in the Cesar province.”In June, Vega opened a new registry office in Arauca that sought to “bridge social gaps” by “generating employment,” according to the national registrar and jailed Arauca Governor Jose Facundo Castillo.Duque’s congressional coalition was showered in criminal charges earlier this month after an allegedly unconstitutional vote to suspend legislation meant to prevent election fraud.Vega has additionally been trying to block 300,000 Colombian citizens who have fled from Venezuela from voting, claiming they would be part of a conspiracy to rig the elections.Colombia may refuse right to vote to citizens who fled Venezuela 2022 electionsAlexander Vegacorruptionelection fraud ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-election-chief-dont-run-if-you-feel-guarantees-are-lacking/,Colombia’s election chief: ‘Don’t run if you feel guarantees are lacking’
" The government of President Ivan Duque reportedly asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to shelve a preliminary investigation into crimes against humanity in the country.According to newspaper El Espectador, the government asked ICC prosecutor Karim Kahn to close the preliminary investigation that was opened in 2004.Kahn is visiting the South American country this week in order to determine whether or not to continue close the file on Colombia.The Duque administration requested an end of the investigation, claiming that several “mechanisms to achieve peace after 50 years of conflict” have been created over the past few years.Since the ICC opened its investigation, two transitional courts have taken force to seek justice for crimes committed by State actors, demobilized FARC guerrillas and former AUC paramilitaries have taken force.Transitional Justice TribunalsJustice and Peace system The Justice and Peace Tribunal came into life in 2005 to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the demobilized paramilitary organization AUC, which demobilized between 2003 and 2006.Special Jurisdiction for PeaceThe Special Jurisdiction for Peace took force in 2018 as part of a peace process with now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and is investigating crimes against humanity committed by the former guerrillas, the security forces and third parties.The Supreme Court surrendered a report on the results of investigations into crimes against humanity committed by congressmen and governors, according to El Espectador.In a letter to Kahn, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, Jose Miguel Vivanco, asked the ICC prosecutor not to shelve the preliminary investigation.According to Vivanco, closing the investigation would be “premature and counterproductive for the goal to secure access to justice of the victims of serious international crimes.”We urge you to keep the preliminary examination open and intensify your efforts to engage with national authorities, victims’ associations and their representatives, other civil society organizations, Colombia’s international partners and other interested parties in efforts to ensure that genuine national processes are in place in the country.HRW Americas director Jose Miguel VivancoKahn can decide to either maintain or close the preliminary investigation, or to press formal criminal charges against alleged war criminals.While in South America, the ICC prosecutor will also visit Venezuela over a pending preliminary investigations into crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the authoritarian regime of President Nicolas Maduro. armed conflictICCWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-asks-icc-to-shelve-crimes-against-humanity-probe/,Colombia asks ICC to shelve crimes against humanity probe

" President Ivan Duque rejected a decision by Colombia’s Senate to create a bilateral commission that seeks to reestablish ties with Venezuela.In a press conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Duque said that he wouldn’t recognize the “disgraceful dictatorship” of his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro.Venezuela’s president expressed his support for the initiative of the Colombian Senate to “normalize” relations.We applaud this initiative taken by the legislature of Colombia and the legislature of Venezuela.Venezuelan President Nicolas MaduroOne thing we cannot be mistaken about is that Colombia will not recognize a disgraceful, corrupt, drug-trafficking dictatorship.Colombian President Ivan DuqueThe proposed commissionSenate President Juan Diego Gomez (Conservative Party) sent the chairman of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, a proposal to create a bilateral commission to reestablish diplomatic and trade ties.According to Gomez, reestablishing ties between the two neighboring countries “is an issue that doesn’t have political ideology, it’s a commercial issue.”Rodriguez said that the National Assembly would be debating the proposal in an extra session on Thursday.The initiative of the Green Alliance opposition party received unanimous support in Colombia’s Senate on Tuesday.The border crisisThe Maduro regime ordered to cut all ties with Bogota in early 2019 after Duque and drug trafficking organization “Los Rastrojos” provided logistical support to a US-backed plot to oust Maduro.The plan sought to forcibly enter Venezuela with “humanitarian” aid from the US, but failed after the convoy led by Venezuelan lawmaker Juan Guaido got stuck on the border.Duque has since refused to consider any reestablishment of ties with Caracas, implying this would recognize Maduro’s disputed 2016 reelection.The breaking down of ties sunk the border region, which largely relies on trade, into a major crisis.The border region effectively full under the control of illegal armed groups that took advantage of the suspended cooperation of security forces.Colombia’s failing state | Part 4: The border with VenezuelaNormalization without DuqueDuque’s grandstanding doesn’t change the fact that the government must do whatever the legislative says whether the increasingly authoritarian president likes it or not.The Senate also doesn’t need approval to advance exploratory talks from Duque, who is set to leave office in August next year.If Venezuelan lawmakers decide to engage in exploratory talks with their counterparts from Bogota, a possible agreement to reestablish ties would likely take a while.If Duque decides to insist on maintaining broken ties with Caracas, this would only delay the possible normalization of diplomatic ties with a few months. border issuescrisis with VenezueladiplomacyForeign AffairsVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-split-over-renewing-ties-with-venezuela/,Colombia split over renewing ties with Venezuela
" Colombia’s increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque is set to suspend electoral guarantees in his regime’s latest and most blatant attack on democracy.Duque’s expressed intention to suspend the “Guarantees Law” makes fair elections unlikely as the initiative throws the door wide open for fraud.The suspension is “grossly unconstitutional,” according to legal experts and electoral observers, and suspends the law that seeks to prevent the use of public funds in election campaigns.Colombia suspends anti-fraud law ahead of 2022 electionsOne vote away from almost absolute powerThe only thing that stands between Duque and almost absolute power is the Constitutional Court where the regime is one seat short of a majority, for now.The Constitutional Court tests the legality of all legislation and is the only body that could still reverse the suspension of the Guarantees Law.The Council of State is set to present the Senate with a shortlist of candidates to replace outgoing Constitutional Court magistrate Alberto Rojas, however.If the Senate elects a government-loyal magistrate, the majority of Constitutional Court will have been elected by the same lawmakers who voted in favor of Duque’s proposal to suspend electoral guarantees.Although at first glance it seems reasonable and democratic for the Council of State to present a diverse shortlist of three candidates in order to give the Senate a greater capacity to take a decision, this is a mistake because the Senate — whose majorities are close to the Government — will choose whoever is closest ideologically, thus reinforcing the presidential influence on the Constitutional Court.Constitutional law expert Rodrigo UprimmyHow democracy came under threatEven if the court deems the suspension of the Guarantees Law unconstitutional, it is unlikely to do so in time to prevent corruption in next year’s elections.In the meantime, the fairness of the elections is in the hands of controversial government allies who have shown little interest in democracy or the rule of law.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa has gone out of his way to obstruct investigations against government allies while pursuing dubious investigations against government opponents.Inspector General Margarita Cabello has opened controversial investigations against opposition politicians who could be ejected from office in violation of international law.Last but not least, Duque doubled the budget of National Registrar Alexander Vega, who has been giving away large sums of money to regional allies who are investigated for corruption by the Supreme Court.Notorious crime family pleased with Colombia’s election chiefHow was Duque able to get away with this?Colombia’s far-right government was able to concentrate this much power through corruption and sheer luck.The government of Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, bribed Congress in 2005 in order to amend the 1991 constitution to allow a second presidential term.The constitutional amendment allowed the “Uribistas” and their mafia allies to seek control over the judicial branch.The attempt failed and many dozens of congressmen and magistrates were jailed on corruption and other criminal charges.Former President Juan Manuel Santos convinced Congress to revoke the amendment after his own reelection in 2014.Santos failed to reestablish the balance of powers, however, as the criminal investigations triggered the premature resignations of top officials in all branches of government.These premature resignations and fraud in the 2018 elections allowed the Uribistas to resume control of the executive and legislative branches, and appoint allies in the judicial branch. corruptionelection fraudIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/how-the-duque-regime-all-but-suspended-democracy-in-colombia/,How the Duque regime all but suspended democracy in Colombia

This situation has contributed to the fact that for years the Wayuu have suffered one of the highest levels of child malnutrition in Colombia, and is of great concern in the current context of Covid-19.HRW Americas director Jose Miguel VivancoStatistics agency DANE said earlier this month that less than 10% of the Wayuu have access to running water.Apart from the food shortages, this lack of clean drinking water “is killing so many children,” the school teacher told Colombia Reports.Criminal negligence?A local “mafia” controls the provision of meals for school children, a local teacher told Colombia ReportsThe Constitutional Court ruled in 2018 that national and regional authorities were in contempt for failing to comply with a 2017 order to curb the high number of deaths among Wayuu children.There is noncompliance with the minimum constitutional standards that apply to the public policies of the National Government, the Department of La Guajira, the municipalities of Riohacha, Manaure, Maicao and Uribia and the indigenous authorities with jurisdiction in these municipalities.Constitutional CourtThe authorities have apparently ignored this order as they have ignored HRW, the Ombudsman, the statistics agency, the Catholic Church and the protesters in Bogota.Opposition Senator Alexander Lopez warned that the situation could get worse as Duque’s 2022 budget would leave family welfare institute ICBF with a $290 million (COP1.1 trillion) budget deficit.Congress has already agreed to reduce mining royalties paid to provinces like La Guajira, which produces approximately 90% of Colombia’s fossil fuels, according to the hunger strikers. childrenhungerhunger strikeLa Guajira ",https://colombiareports.com/children-in-northern-colombia-dying-of-hunger-thirst-and-government-neglect/,"Children in northern Colombia dying of hunger, thirst and government neglect"

We express our condolences to his family. We urge the authorities to investigate these events. We call for respect for the life and protection of children.United Nations human rights officeThe 12-year-old boy and an 18-year-old teenager were apprehended by shopkeepers who were subsequently surprised by two armed men who took the alleged shopkeepers.The victims’ bodies were found on a road in Tibu the next morning. A sign saying “thieves” was left on the body of the youngest victim.The absence of authoritiesThe violent incident increased tensions between locals and regional police chief Colonel Carlos Martinez who ordered the arrest of three locals, claiming they were complicit in the double homicide.The locals released multiple press releases and videos that would prove that two armed men took the alleged shoplifters by force before they could take them to the police station themselves.In an interview with Caracol Radio, Martinez claimed that the locals never called the police, but decided to “take justice in their own hands. That’s what the authorities are for.”A local said that “we called several times and they didn’t answer. We thought that the worst would happen, which effectively did.”Unfortunately, right now you don’t see the authorities in our municipality, they are conspicuous by their absence.

We don’t want to see them tomorrow dumped on a road out there. They are under our responsibility, so we will surrender them to the authorities… look at the face of this boy, it’s a child.Excerpt from video 1In a second video, a man said he would take responsibility for the alleged shoplifters. Confusingly, this man first said he would take the victims “all over the place” and subsequently said “we are going straight to the station.”CCTV footage released by the shopkeepers showed that two other men arrived and — following a short struggle — took the two victims away on two motorbikes.Hours later, the bodies of the victims were found just outside of town.

" Colombia’s security forces appear to have left locals in the region around Colombia’s main city on the border with Venezuela at the mercy of illegal armed groups.The Catatumbo region in Norte de Santander has historically suffered state abandonment, which has forced the locals to live under guerrilla rule for decades.Paramilitary groups that fight the guerrillas in the countryside have long been financed by organized crime in Cucuta and its Venezuelan sister city San Cristobal.The power of the illegal armed groups has marginalized and corrupted local police and army units that are supposed to control the border.The latest crisisCatatumbo’s latest security crisis is caused by an unprecedented number of illegal armed groups that are vying for control over the border region that is one of Colombia’s main coca growing regions.These illegal armed groups have specifically been targeting community leaders who aspire one of the congressional seats reserved for Catatumbo as part of a 2016 peace deal with now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.Women are another target after they organized in opposition of the forced recruitment of their children, Carmen Garcia of the Association of Catatumbo Mothers for Peace told newspaper El Espectador.We will not give birth to another child for the war. We prepare ourselves to teach them that weapons are only good for killing. We have listened to the reincorporated members of the FARC in the region who say that they have achieved nothing with weapons and that bothers the groups, both the illegal ones and the army or the police.Social leader Carmen GarciaAccording to Fundacion Progresar, a human rights organization from Cucuta, 22 community leaders and forced another 22 to flee the border region because of death threats since 2020.Nine massacres were committed in Catatumbo and Cucuta since the beginning of last year, according to think tank Indepaz.Violence against civilians since 2020The political violenceViolence against community leaders in Catatumbo increased after the Constitutional Court granted the region extra seats in Congress as part of the peace process with the FARC earlier this year.This political violence has made it virtually impossible for these representatives to campaign ahead of the congressional elections in March next year.We suffered displacement and confinement after the kidnappings and murders of our colleagues. This has affected the development of our work, because so far we have not been able to return. The same groups are still there and more are coming… Of course one gets scared because they even mess with our families.Social leader Saul Alfonso CaceresMireya Leon, a representative of the Catatumbo Women’s Network, decided she wouldn’t even try to run for office after  armed men forced the women’s rights activist to flee the region in February.Two guys smashed me against a gate and told me that they did not want to see me leading peace initiatives, or advising victims or human rights defenders. I filed reports at the Prosecutor General’s Office, at the Ombudsman’s Office, I had to leave everything behind and nothing has happened. And I bet that when this interview comes out, my life will be at greater risk.Social leader Mireya LeonLocals have little faith in the security forces that have been connected to illegal armed groups and organized crime on multiple occasions.Furthermore, locals have complained that the authorities are behind much of the terror.The majority of the threats come from the authorities themselves… We leaders have in 1999 already lived through the massacres and mass displacement because of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, and we don’t want their successors to come back. They perceive us as guerrillas instead of human rights defenders.Social leader Carmen GarciaThe retreat of the security forcesThe security forces have been unable to provide security after the 33rd Brigade was ordered to assist the Cucuta Police Department in maintaining order in the city in July.Consequently, locals are left at the mercy of guerrilla group ELN, FARC dissidents and the paramilitary groups that are trying to oust the rebels.Illegal armed groups in CatatumboAll illegal armed groups combined have some 1,500 armed members in Norte de Santander, one of the regional police commanders, General Fabio Cancelado, told newspaper El Tiempo.The National army’s 33rd Brigade has largely been forced to retreat to Cucuta after a series of events that threatened public order in the city.The Catatumbo state collapseA global collapse in commodity prices in 2014 triggered a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has spurred millions to flee to Colombia.The demobilization of guerrilla group FARC in 2017 created a power vacuum in Catatumbo.Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro closed the border with Colombia in 2019, which forced migrants to cross the border via smuggling routes controlled by illegal armed groups.The coronavirus pandemic surged unemployment and violent crime in Cucuta in 2020.In order to help the Cucuta Police Department to secure public order in the city, the 33rd National Army Brigade was forced to reduce its presence in the countryside.Police remain in the towns throughout Cucuta but barely leave their stations, which allows the illegal armed groups to impose their rule without relatively little opposition.Tibu Police DepartmentELN graffiti in CatatumboCucuta slum on Venezuelan borderCoca field in TibuIs there hope for Catatumbo?“The situation we are in now is the responsibility of the government” for failing to implement the peace deal with the FARC and agreeing to measures to reduce violence against civilians, farmers’ representative Juan Quintero told newspaper El Espectador.Quintero and other regional leaders have been promoting a “humanitarian agreement” between all armed actors in an attempt to reduce violence in Catatumbo ahead of the 2022 elections.Humanitarian agreementNo violence against civiliansNo attacks on public buildings like churches and schoolsBan on landminesBan on child recruitmentFreedom of movement of civiliansBan on violence that impedes civilians to workBan on violence on humanitarian missionsThe ELN, the EPL and FARC dissident groups have expressed their support for the humanitarian agreement, the farmers’ leader said.“The only actor that until now has not responded is the Colombian State,” according to Quintero.Without any state commitment, the community leaders believe that “it will be impossible” to reduce violence.

" The Americas chief of Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged Colombia’s government to implement a 2016 peace deal on Sunday after the report of another massacre.According to think tank Indepaz, the massacre of five people in the town of Betania, Antioquia, on Sunday was the 76th this year.Quantifying terrorHRW Americas chief Jose Miguel Vivanco said that the number of massacres reported this year was similar to the number of massacres before the beginning of a peace process with now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.Vivanco’s claim was confirmed by Defense Ministry statistics that indicated that the number of massacres committed between January and August was the highest since 2011.The defense Ministry, which considers the mass killing of more than four people a massacre, said that 109 people were killed in massacres using the government definition.Massacres between January and August According to statistics maintained by Indepaz, at least 275 people people were killed in massacres of more than three people so far this year.The majority of victims fell in southwest Colombia where a relatively large number of illegal armed groups have been vying for control over territory that used to be controlled by the FARC.Massacre victims in 2021Failing peace processThe HRW chief stressed that “Colombia has a mechanism to stop the violence: point 3.4 of the peace deal,” which sought security guarantees for vulnerable communities, social leaders and demobilized guerrillas.President Ivan Duque, whose far-right party has fiercely opposed the peace process, has come under fire in Colombia and abroad for his reluctance to implement this part of the peace deal.The president, who has insisted that his administration has been successful in implementing peace policies, did not respond to the latest massacre.Duque’s success claims have contradicted statistics and independent observers of the peace process that began in 2016 after four years of negotiations between the FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos.What is happening in Colombia?The increase in massacres is primarily due to the security forces’ failure to assume control over former guerrilla territory after the FARC’s demobilization and disarmament in 2017.The power vacuum caused by the security forces was filled by ELN guerrillas, paramilitaries of the AGC and a multitude of illegal armed groups with the support of drug traffickers.Some of these armed groups are explicitly in opposition of the peace process and have been behind most of the violence against civilians.

" A court order the release of the fixer of Colombia’s former president Alvaro Uribe on Wednesday after the prosecution failed to timely file charges.Diego Cadena will be able to await the rest of his trial in liberty because prosecutor Daniel Hernandez failed to formally charge the self-proclaimed “gangstattorney.”According to Hernandez, Cadena’s defense attorneys used dilatory tactics to prevent timely court proceedings over the alleged criminal practices of Uribe’s former fixer.Is Daniel Hernandez Colombia’s most corrupt prosecutor in history?The delayed court proceedingsCadena, who allegedly bribed witnesses to testify in favor of the former president, is set to be formally charged next week.A judge placed Uribe’s former fixer under house arrest in October 2019 after Hernandez indicted Cadena on charges of, among other things, fraud and bribery.The defense of the gangstattorney had asked an appeals court to revoke the detention measures, claiming that Uribe’s fixer hadn’t formally been charged within a year.The release of Cadena was opposed by the designated victims of the alleged fraud and bribery practices of Uribe and his fixer.Colombia’s prosecution claims Uribe victim of fraud, bribery he allegedly committedUribe hoping to be absolvedIn a different courtroom, a judge is considering the request of prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes to absolve Colombia’s former president and the political patron of President Ivan Duque.Uribe’s alleged victims have been arguing against this over the past week, claiming that the prosecutor omitted evidence that would prove the former president committed fraud and bribery.Jaimes has been broadly criticized and was reprimanded by the court for trying to drop the criminal charges against Uribe without the approval of a judge.Colombia’s prosecution facing criminal charges over Uribe probeThe alleged crimesThe prosecution investigation against Cadena is the consequence of a Supreme Court investigation into the former president’s alleged fraud and witness manipulation practices.According to the high court, evidence indicates that Uribe ordered his former fixer to bribe witnesses in an attempt to press fraudulent criminal charges against Senator Ivan Cepeda in 2014.According to Uribe, Cepeda manipulated witnesses to testify that the former president and his brother formed paramilitary groups that committed countless massacres and murders.The court absolved Cepeda and opened an investigation against Uribe in 2018.The prosecution was put in charge of investigating the former president and his fixer after Uribe resigned from the Senate, effectively renouncing his congressional privileges last year.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prison Alvaro UribeDaniel HernandezDiego CadenaparapoliticsUribe trial ",https://colombiareports.com/fixer-of-colombias-former-president-released-ahead-of-fraud-and-bribery-trial/,Fixer of Colombia’s former president released ahead of fraud and bribery trial
" The extradition of one of Colombia’s most controversial businessmen to the United States triggered the suspension of talks that sought to end a crisis in Venezuela.The authoritarian government of President Nicolas Maduro suspended talks with Venezuela’s opposition in Mexico hours after Cape Verde’s authorities extradited Alex Saab to the US.The corruption charges that justified the American extradition request don’t incriminate Maduro or prominent members of Venezuela’s regime.What may have triggered the strong reaction from Caracas is Saab’s alleged role as Maduro’s financial fixer and “super minister.”If there was a lack of milk in Venezuela, they called Saab’s cell phone. If there was a lack of fuel, they called him to solve the situation. And in view of the shortage of foreign currency, they proposed to him to devise a model for the very direct sale of gold bars, and then he would go with his plane — or hire other planes — and sell gold in Turkey. He was the man who solved everything and had more functions than any other Venezuelan minister, or was busier at least.Journalist Gerardo ReyesFrom Barranquilla’s capitalists to Caracas’ socialistsSaab and his brother Amir Luis were born into Barranquilla’s business elite thanks to the textile business set up by their father, who fled to Colombia in 1956 to escape war in his native country, Lebanon.The family patriarch became a fierce critic of the US government because of its meddling in Lebanese politics and failed attempts to link the businessman to drug trafficking and terrorism, according to Reyes’ book “Alex Saab.”The Saab brothers reportedly increased their power in the Caribbean region in the early 2000’s through strategic political and legal alliances.One of their lawyers, Abeladro de la Espriella, was close to then-president Alvaro Uribe and one of the politicians they sponsored, former Senator Piedad Cordoba, was an ally of Uribe’s counterpart in Venezuela, late President Hugo Chavez.Abelardo de la Espriella and Piedad Cordoba.Cordoba’s mediation between Caracas and Bogota became a major business opportunity for Saab in 2011 when Chavez and Uribe’s successor, former President Juan Manuel Santos, revived diplomatic relations.The newly improved relations secured Chavez’s support for a peace process in Colombia Saab’s investment in Venezuela’s social programs.The Colombian businessman became increasingly important for the Venezuelan government after the 2013 election of Maduro and subsequent US sanctions.The credible crime allegationsClaims by Florida prosecutors that Saab would be involved in financial crimes are confirmed by independent journalists, and prosecutors in Switzerland, Italy and Colombia.The Miami investigations focused on the alleged embezzlement of Venezuelan government funds between 2011 and 2015 by the Saab and his business associates Alvaro Pulido.According to Colombia’s prosecution, Saab was involved in all kinds of financial fraud and money laundering years before that already.Prosecutors from the Americas and Europe, and journalistic investigations like the Panama Papers have revealed the Saab Network’s alleged financial and real estate assets around the globe.The alleged housing racketThe corruption investigation of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) centers around the alleged embezzlement of hundreds of millions of dollars through the “Global Construction Fund” of the Barranquilla businessmen.As part of the 2011 deal with Santos, Chavez granted this fund a $150 million contract to provide building materials between 2012 and 2013 for his “Great Housing Mission” that sought to build 2.6 million homes.Saab and Pulido only delivered $3 million in building materials until the Venezuelan president’s death in late 2013, according to Venezuelan investigative journalism website Armado.info.The mass embezzlement was made possible with the help of bribed officials who were in charge of certifying strictly regulated import payments.Saab and Pulido additionally used an international network of accounts to inflate the value of dollars whose value was artificially maintained low in Venezuela by monetary regulations.The defendants and their co-conspirators then allegedly took advantage of Venezuela’s government-controlled exchange rate, under which U.S. dollars could be obtained at a favorable rate, by submitting false and fraudulent import documents for goods and materials that were never imported into Venezuela and bribing Venezuelan government officials to approve those documents.US Department of JusticeAccording to the DOJ, the Barranquilla businessmen received $350 million that was funneled to bank accounts in tax havens and the US.Miami bank accounts were used to pay Venezuelan officials, the DOJ said in its 2019 indictment of Saab and Pulido.The capital reported by the Saab Network in Colombia during these years was nowhere near the estimated capital of the Barranquilla businessmen, according to investigative journalism website Connectas.The Saab Network’s reported capitalThe unfounded accusationsThe alleged food racketThe US Treasury additionally accused the Colombian businessmen of expanding their embezzlement practices to a food distribution program with the help of family members of Venezuela’s president in 2016.According to former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the so-called CLAP racket embezzled funds through the corruption network initially set up to embezzle housing funds.The corruption network that operates the CLAP program has allowed Maduro and his family members to steal from the Venezuelan people.  They use food as a form of social control, to reward political supporters and punish opponents, all the while pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars through a number of fraudulent schemes.Former US Treasury Secretary Steven MnuchinThe allegations weren’t confirmed by the DOJ or included in the criminal indictment against the Colombian, but justified sanctions against the Maduro family in 2019.Terrorism and drug trafficking allegationsThe accusations of Saab’s involvement in the alleged CLAP racket were apparently part of a failed attempt by the administration of former US President Donald Trump to topple his Venezuelan counterpart.This attempts included all kinds of unfounded criminal investigations carried out by controversial former District Attorney Geoffrey Berman, one of Trump’s political allies in New York.Berman’s allegations included exotic conspiracy theories that linked Maduro to drug trafficking and Saab to Hezbollah without any evidence.Maduro and the other defendants expressly intended to flood the United States with cocaine in order to undermine the health and well-being of our nation. Maduro very deliberatively used cocaine as a weapon.Former New York prosecutor Geoffrey BermanFrom at least in or about 1996, up to and including in or about 2005, in Lebanon, and elsewhere, and in an offense begun and committed out of the jurisdiction of any particular State or district of the United States, Alexei Saab, a.k.a. “Ali Hassan Saab,” a.k.a. “Alex Saab, a.k.a. “Rachid,” the defendant, who was first arrested in the Southern District of New York, knowingly received military-type training from and on behalf of Hizbollah.Former New York prosecutor Geoffrey BermanCriminal charges against Saab in ColombiaUnusual capital growth between 2004 and 2006The use of front companies for imports and exportsAccounting fraudFictitious exportsThe unjustified inflow of $16.4 million between 2004 and 2011, mainly from VenezuelaNo holistic investigationThe extradition of Maduro’s alleged money man was a major political blow for the Venezuelan government, but mainly because of optics.The prosecutors of the Southern District of Florida have indicted Saab exclusively over the alleged embezzlement of Venezuelan housing funds so far.Maduro and his government would be in trouble only if their Colombian ally decides to blow the whistle on corruption allegations that aren’t being investigated in the US.

" Colombia’s defense minister will have to explain Congress why four minors and no ELN commander died in a bombardment on a guerrilla camp in September.Opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda on Thursday revealed that one 13-year-old boy and three 17-year-old girls died in a September 16 bombing that was supposed to kill ELN commander “Fabian.”I will summon the defense minister, Diego Molano, to explain the new episode of bombing minors during a political control session in the Senate.Senator Ivan CepedaPresidential hopeful Camilo Romero of the Green Alliance party demanded the resignation of Defense Minister Diego Molano.The defense minister blamed the guerrillas for “forcibly recruiting minors and placing them within a military objective.”Colombia’s defense chief under fire over bombing minorsThe “surgical operation” that missed its targetMolano was already in a fix over the bombing because he falsely claimed that the commander of the ELN’s Western War Front died in the military operation.Fabian wasn’t among the eight people who were killed in the bombardment on an alleged guerrilla camp in Litoral de San Juan, a municipality in the western Choco province.Nevertheless, Interior Minister Daniel Palacios called the bombing a “surgical operation” of “high precision.”The ELN commander was captured 11 days after the bombing and died in a Cali hospital on September 28.The guerrillas confirmed the death of “Fabian,” but challenged Molano’s claim that the top commander was injured in the bombardment.Top commander of Colombia’s ELN guerrillas dies in hospitalThe debate on child soldiersThe killing of children during a bombing on a guerrilla camp forced the resignation of President Ivan Duque’s first defense minister Guillermo Botero in 2019.Molano defended the latest incident and denied that the deaths of the minors constituted a violation of International Humanitarian Law.This is a questionable claim, mainly because the Geneva Convention’s protocol on the protection of children is open to interpretation, especially when it comes to child soldiers who are 15 and older.This is complicated further by the fact that there is no evidence to indicate that the minors were child soldiers as they weren’t killed in combat, but bombed to death.Article 77Children shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected against any form of indecent assault. The Parties to the conflict shall provide them with the care and aid they require, whether because of their age or for any other reason.The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces. In recruiting among those persons who have attained the age of fifteen years but who have not attained the age of eighteen years, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavor to give priority to those who are oldest.If, in exceptional cases, despite the provisions of paragraph 2, children who have not attained the age of fifteen years take a direct part in hostilities and fall into the power of an adverse Party, they shall continue to benefit from the special protection accorded by this Article, whether or not they are prisoners of war.If arrested, detained or interned for reasons related to the armed conflict, children shall be held in quarters separate from the quarters of adults, except where families are accommodated as family units as provided in Article 75, paragraph 5.The death penalty for an offence related to the armed conflict shall not be executed on persons who had not attained the age of eighteen years at the time the offence was committed.Molano’s attempt to lay the blame on the ELN is even more questionable as the guerrillas’ alleged recruitment of the 13-year-old boy in no way allows the military to also commit war crimes. armed conflictDiego MolanoELNmilitaryWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-defense-minister-called-to-congress-over-child-bombings/,Colombia’s defense minister called to Congress over child bombings

" Renewed violence and armed conflict in Colombia forced more than 57,000 people to flee their homes so far this year, according to the United Nations.A report by UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA confirmed claims by Ombudsman Carlos Camargo, who rang the alarm about a sharp increase in forced displacement in July already.Forced displacement since January 2020Armed conflict and failing peace policiesBoth the UN and the Ombudsman blamed the surge in forced displacement on illegal armed groups that forced entire communities to flee to other parts of the country.Local NGO’s additionally blamed the government of President Ivan Duque of failing to implement a 2016 peace deal with demobilized FARC guerrillas, according to the OAS’ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).Specifically, the IACHR stressed the governments failures to implement counternarcotics and rural development policies that would be part of the peace process.Mass expulsions between January and JulyThe IACHR urged the Colombian government and security forces to comply with their obligations to prevent forced displacement, provide security and offer humanitarian support to conflict victims.The IACHR urges the State of Colombia to redouble its efforts to formulate and implement public policies that effectively transform the structural causes of violence in the country, through comprehensive actions that guarantee the right to life, security and justice, as well as access to economic, social, cultural and environmental rights for this population. In this sense, it makes a special call to the State to strengthen the measures aimed at the integral fulfillment of the Peace Agreement, in the understanding that this constitutes an ideal tool to confront the structural causes of violence in the country.IACHRDuque denies realityDuque carefully avoided any mention of forced displacement and rejected the IACHR’s claim that the government has failed to comply with the peace deal in his response.The president on Saturday admitted that “of course there are challenges,” but added that the most recent UN report on the peace process “showed advances.”We must continue to confront the criminals who want to assassinate social leaders and former combatants, but we continue to move forward with peace here and it would be good if the Commission could read the report of who does the review and monitoring in Colombia, which is the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations.President Ivan DuqueThe report by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres confirmed the Duque’s failures to implement the elements of the peace deal that were highlighted by the IACHR.In fact, the UN chief urged Duque to accelerate the implementation of the peace deal specifically in the regions where forced displacement has surged.It is in areas such as these that the implementation of comprehensive rural reform and actions to strengthen the integrated presence of state institutions would make the greatest difference in curbing violence.UN Secretary General Antonio GuterresWho is behind the mass displacement?According to think tank Codhes, unidentified armed were responsible for half of the forced displacement registered in Colombia in 2020.In cases that Codhes was able to identify an aggressor, paramilitary groups were the main cause of mass displacement followed by groups formed by FARC dissidents and guerrillas of the ELN.Illegal armed groupsParamilitary groups have continued to be the primary cause of displacement in Colombia after the demobilization of their former umbrella organization AUC between 2003 and 2006 by Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.In thousands of cases, these paramilitary groups displaced rural communities to help regional elites and corporations accumulate land through land dispossession rackets.As a consequence, more than 16% of Colombia’s entire population had been forcibly displaced by the end of 2020, according to the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR.People affected by forced displacementDuque and the paramilitariesThe president was elected in 2018 with the help of the regional elites and convicted drug lord Marquitos Figueroa, a former member of the AUC.The Supreme Court sentenced one of Duque’s political patrons to prison on Friday while investigating Uribe’s alleged role in the 2018 election fraud.The investigations into the ties between the president’s political allies and paramilitary groups have devastated public support for Duque and his political party. armed conflictforced displacementIACHRpeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-new-wave-of-forced-displacement/,Colombia’s new wave of forced displacement

" Paramilitary groups remained active in almost one in every five of Colombia’s municipalities after the demobilization of paramilitary organization AUC in 2006, according to a think tank.In its annual report, think tank Indepaz said that almost two thirds of Colombia’s municipality saw some activity by paramilitary groups between 2008 and 2020.Some 200 municipalities registered paramilitary violence during at least eight of the past 13 years, according to the think tanks.The areas with this type of high intensity paramilitary violence were primarily located in northwestern Colombia, the stomping ground of the AUC, the Caribbean region and in the coca-growing regions south of the capital Bogota.The capital and other major cities continued to register high levels of violence by these AUC successor groups since the paramilitary demobilization process of former President Alvaro Uribe, according to Indepaz.AGC reigns supremeParamilitary group AGC was by far the most dominant of AUC successor groups in 2020, according to Indepaz.The group that is led by dissident AUC member “Otoniel” was active in 237 municipalities last year, the think tank said.In fact, the AGC was the only group that was actively throughout Colombia while other groups operated mainly on a regional level.The group is considered Colombia’s largest drug trafficking organization by the US government and has created a business empire allowing the paramilitaries to launder money and finance political campaigns.In the Uraba region, the AGC’s stomping ground, the paramilitaries control much of the regional economy and political without any interference from the security forces.The remaining groupsA dozen paramilitary groups that are considerably smaller than the AGC are active throughout Colombia, according to Indepaz.These groups are involved in similar criminal activity as the AGC, but generally operate on a regional level like “Los Pachencas” that controls the region around Santa Marta and “La Local” that controls the port of Buenaventura.An exception to this rule are “Los Rastrojos” who have small cells in regions and cities considered of strategic importance for cocaine exports.Territorial expansionFor the first time in a decade, Indepaz registered in increase in municipalities with paramilitary activity.According to the think tank, the AGC and their smaller counterparts appear to have used the Covi-19 pandemic to increase their territorial control.This territorial expansion has contributed to an increase in violence throughout Colombia.In some areas, disputes between paramilitary groups triggered turf wars while in other areas they clashed with ELN guerrillas or dissidents of the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group.The FARC dissidents have been trying to recover territory that was lost when their former guerrilla organization demobilized and disarmed in 2017 and also the ELN has been branching out.The security forces have carried out attacks against the ELN and the FARC dissidents, but have apparently not been fighting the paramilitary groups with a similar force.

" Guerrilla group ELN on Wednesday confirmed that the commander of the rebel group’s units in western Colombia died in a hospital in the city of Cali.In a press statement, the ELN confirmed the death of “Fabian,” the commander of the guerrillas’ Western War Front, which controls much of Colombia’s Pacific coast.Minister lied about ELN commander’s deathThe guerrillas’ confirmation ended almost two weeks of speculation about the ELN commander’s fate after Defense Minister Diego Molano falsely announced Fabian’s death on September 21.According to Molano, the death of the ELN commander in a September 17 bombardment in the western Choco province was the security forces’ “hardest blow in recent months to the Western War Front.”The defense minister lied as Fabian wasn’t among the seven alleged guerrillas killed in the bombardment.Molano announced the ELN’s commander’s death for a second time on Tuesday, claiming Fabian wasn’t captured until Monday.According to the defense minister, soldiers found the ELN commander “wounded, covered with bushes and vegetation” after which Fabian was transported to a hospital in Cali where the guerrilla chief died.This time, Molano claimed that the guerrilla commander’s death was “the biggest blow of President Ivan Duque’s government to the ELN.”ELN demands Red Cross to verify “assassination”The ELN questioned Molano’s claim that Fabian was found injured and accused the military of “assassinating” the guerrillas’ Western War Front commander.Now the Government changes the version and summons the press to say that Fabian did not die on September 16, but that he had been wounded and remained alive for 11 days; the curious thing is that he does not die while wounded and alone in the jungle, and ends up dying in a clinic 12 hours after being captured alive.ELNThe guerrilla group asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct an independent autopsy on Fabian to establish how the guerrilla commander died.The ELN additionally claimed that the government “disproportionate use of military forces and explosives” effectively “authorized” the guerrillas to do the same.Implicit warning ELN may escalate violenceThe implicit warning that the guerrillas may escalate violence against the “despotic, tyrannical and terrorist regime” comes after months of extremely low levels of violence compared to previous years in the armed conflict that has lasted more than half a century.According to the Defense Ministry, guerrilla attacks against oil pipelines and public infrastructure dropped 75% between January and August compared to the same period last year.The ELN carried out only one attack against the armed forces in the first eight months of the year against 26 in the same period in 2020.The relatively few guerrilla attacks followed the government’s appointment of “peace managers” who have been authorized to talk to the Colombian government and ELN negotiators in Cuba.  armed conflictELN ",https://colombiareports.com/top-commander-of-colombias-eln-guerrillas-dies-in-hospital/,Top commander of Colombia’s ELN guerrillas dies in hospital
" Unemployment in Colombia dropped to its lowest lowest since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, statistics agency DANE announced Wednesday.According to DANE, the national unemployment rate was 12.3% in August, a rate not seen since February 2020.Unemployment was still considerably higher than in the same month in 2019 when unemployment in Colombia was 10.8%Notwithstanding, the DAN has registered dropping unemployment for three consecutive months, indicating that more and more people have been able to recover the jobs they lost during the pandemic.Colombia’s monthly unemployment rateLong way to recoveryThe dropping unemployment is causing only cautious optimism as many of the people who were able to recover employment were unable to meet their economic needs.Of the 24.7 million people who were employed in August, more than a quarter said they were not earning enough to get by, primarily because their wages didn’t meet their needs or because they weren’t making enough hours.Women facing biggest challengesFurthermore, the recovery of jobs has been considerably more easy for men than for women, who were hit the hardest by the pandemic in the first place.DANE director Juan Daniel Oviedo told media that for every man who has yet to recover his job, 20 women are waiting to be employed again.The unemployment rate among women between June and August was 18.1% compared to 10.6% among men, according to the statistics agency.The youth questionDANE didn’t release any data on youth unemployment, which is considered one of the main challenges of Colombia’s largest cities.Medellin’s City Council on Wednesday said that the unemployment rate among inhabitants younger than 28 surged to 27.4% in 2020.More than 55% of this city’s youth were entirely inactive as many also have no access to education.The lack of jobs and education opportunities in urban areas appears to also disproportionately affect women, according to the Medellin statistics that indicated that 6 out of 10 young women were neither working not going to school. coronaviruseconomic reactivationlaborunemployment ",https://colombiareports.com/unemployment-in-colombia-drops-to-pandemics-lowest-level/,Unemployment in Colombia drops to pandemic’s lowest level

" The governments of the United States and Colombia are seeking a new bilateral counternarcotics strategy.In a press statement, the so-called Counternarcotics Work Group said officials from both countries have been working on a “new bilateral strategy” to combat drug trafficking.The new “holistic” approachThe bilateral team said that it would be announcing specifics of the “holistic approach” to combat drug trafficking between the world’s biggest producer of cocaine and the largest consumption market of the illicit drugs.This holistic approach would include specific policies focusing on Colombia’s countryside where much of Colombia’s cocaine is produced and illegal armed groups are often in control.Rough outlines of new counternarcotics strategyPromote the sustainable presence of the State in the countrysideAccelerate “comprehensive rural development”Guarantee the protection of human rightsStrengthen the rule of lawAccording to the bilateral work group, their joint counternarcotics strategy would initially be implemented in three priority municipalities, Tumaco, Caceres and Sardinita.These municipalities are strategically important because of the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, and their access to Colombia’s main export hubs.Other elements of the new policyThe increased investments in coca-growing regions would allow Colombia’s police to “sustainably eradicate coca” and prevent the replanting of coca.The Counternarcotics Work Group additionally seeks to squeeze the import of chemicals used to produce cocaine and step up interceptions of drug shipments.Additionally, the two governments seek to “reduce illicit cash transactions, prioritize the arrest and extradition of key drug traffickers and their aides, and strengthen the judicial system.”According to the Counternarcotics Work Group, US authorities will be also be actively involved in the pending reform of Colombia’s police force, which would “strengthen the capacity of the police to counter drug trafficking and organized crime.”The wars for Colombia’s cocaine containers | Part 1: BuenaventuraChallenges for the new strategyThe latest counternarcotics proposal would be “new” if Bogota and Washington DC will keep their word for once.Colombia’s farmers have been promised rural investment and an end to state neglect for decades, but only few have actually seen this happen.Coca farmers from the priority areas may be reluctant to take part in any counternarcotics experiment after farmers taking part in the previous one were literally left to starve.Additionally, illegal armed groups will likely try to sabotage any counternarcotics policy that threatens their drug trafficking revenue.Last but not least, government corruption continues to pose a threat to the implementation of any kind of policy.The drug trafficking problem of Colombia’s CongressThe end of the “War on Drugs”The government of US President Joe Biden has been developing a new counternarcotics strategy in Colombia in an attempt to end the “War on Drugs.”According to US authorities, some 93,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2020, making last year the most fatal since late President Richard Nixon declared “war” on “public enemy number one” in 1971.Americans dying of drugsColombia’s potential cocaine production reached an all-time high last year despite efforts by President Ivan Duque to ramp up the forced eradication of coca.Last year’s record cocaine production was a new low for the South American country that became a major player in the global drug trade as a direct consequence of the War on Drugs.Colombia’s potential cocaine productionThe Nixon administration’s initial strategy to spray Mexican marijuana fields with chemicals that were believed to be harmful for American pot smokers boosted production in Colombia.Within years, drug smugglers began using the marijuana routes to smuggle cocaine and heroin to the US. counternarcoticsdrug traffickingUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/us-colombia-seeking-new-holistic-counternarcotics-strategy/,"US, Colombia seeking new, ‘holistic’ counternarcotics strategy"
" Months after Colombia’s government called for help in a migration crisis on the border with Panama, the estimated number of stuck migrants has more than doubled to 20,000.Colombia’s migration agency in July called for international support to deal with an unfolding migration crisis in Necocli, a small coastal town in northwestern Colombia near the border.NecocliCall for help not loud enough?The call for help failed to prevent that the number of people waiting to make the dangerous journey through the Darien Gap to Panama doubled in just three months.The surge is largely due to a humanitarian crisis in Haiti, the Caribbean island from where thousands have fled so far this year.Colombia was already a major destination for people fleeing Venezuela and a major transit hub from people fleeing Cuba.Statistics provided by Panamanian authorities indicate that some of the Haitians travels as far south as Brazil and Chile before traveling to Colombia.Origin of “irregular” migrants traveling from Colombia to Panama (2021)The routesStatistics from both Colombian and Panamanian migration agencies indicate that the Haitian migrants are using the Pan-American Highway that has long been used by Cuban migrants.This highway allows migrants to travel from Chile and Peru to Necocli via Colombia’s second largest city Medellin.From Necocli, the migrants travel by boat to the jungles on the Panamanian border or to the Caribbean coast of Colombia’s neighbor to the north.The bottleneckNecocli has historically been a bottleneck in migration from South America because the Pan-American Highway is interrupted on the border between Panama and Colombia.The only way to cross the border is to cross the Gulf of Uraba by boat and following the “Route of Death” through the lawless jungles and swamps of the Darien Gap on foot.The growing crisis in Necocli is due to the fact that the recent exodus from Haiti has overwhelmed the human traffickers, a.k.a. “coyotes,” who historically control illegal migration from Colombia to Panama.Migration authorities from Panama and Colombia agreed to facilitate the regulated border crossing of some 650 people a day earlier this month.Some 180 and 200 people a day would be traveling from Necocli to Medellin after apparently giving up to cross the border for now, migration sources told regional newspaper El Colombiano.Notwithstanding, national migration authorities told newspaper El Tiempo that the number of migrants stuck in Necocli continued to grow and would reach 22,000 this weekend.The “Route of Death”The bilateral attempt to regulate migration has prevented mass drownings in the Gulf of Uraba, but has failed to prevent people dying on the “Route of Death” through the Darien Gap.Panama’s prosecution said on Friday that the bodies of eight adults and two children were found in the jungle near the Colombian border.The bodies of 41 people have been found along the “Route of Death” so far this year, according to Panamanian authorities.On the Colombian side of the border, authorities are increasingly desperate about the growing humanitarian crisis in Necocli and Medellin.

" Colombia’s most powerful paramilitary leader has turned the largest manhunt since Pablo Escobar into one of the security forces’ greatest embarrassments.Former President Juan Manuel Santos announced “Operation Agamedon” in February 2012, claiming that the operation to capture or kill “Otoniel” was the biggest manhunt since the operation that killed late drug lord in 1993.The police needed less than a year and a half to kill Escobar in one of his hideouts in the city of Medellin after the drug lord spectacular prison break in 1991.Almost a decade after Santos deployed some 1,200 men to capture and kill the man accused by the United States of leading Colombia’s largest drug trafficking organizations, Otoniel is still free.Instead of trying to capture or kill Colombia’s most powerful warlord, President Ivan Duque has embarked on a propaganda offensive in an apparent attempt to conceal the fact that the security forces are avoid doing their job.A decade of blowing smokePresident Ivan Duque (Image: President’s Office)If the stories about the deteriorating health of the 51-year old AGC chief are true, the chances of Otoniel dying of natural causes are more likely than the paramilitary chief getting caught by police.In late August, President Ivan Duque revealed that Otoniel was having increasing trouble evading the police because of the paramilitary leader’s diabetes and high blood pressure.Additionally, the alleged offensives targeting the AGC chief would have caused such “fear” of the military tracking his GPS coordinates, Otoniel no longer used cell phones, “intelligence” told weekly government-loyal weekly Semana.Duque may be suffering memory loss as the AGC boss stopped using electronic equipment and was taking medication for his kidneys and pain killers to treat lower back pains before 2015 already, police sources told government-loyal media.At the time, Otoniel allegedly was “feeling more cornered and demoralized” every day and even “believed he was finished,” far-right columnist Salud Hernandez reported based on military intelligence sources.Six years later, military intelligence appears to have learned nothing new, yet the AGC chief should be fearing “the full force of the security forces,” according to Duque. Either he submits to the authorities or he will receive the full weight of the law and the full force of our security forces.President Ivan DuqueColombia’s prosecution says AGC is four times bigger than police estimatesThe full force of the StateTwo weeks ago, National Police chief Jorge Luis Vargas said that “we have police intelligence operations, and police as well as soldiers to arrest him in the region around the border of the Cordoba and the Antioquia provinces.A few days later, the National Army claimed having killed seven AGC members in the Nudo de Paramillo region in response to an alert issued by the human rights office in February last year.In response, Otoniel’s men killed five soldiers and injured another three in the region last week.Duque ordered Defense Minister Diego Molano to “maintain the siege on this criminal organization,” but nothing happened. According to the president, the killing of the AGC members earlier this month cornered Otoniel, which was “why he’s carrying out these cowardly attacks.”Independent journalists reported last week that the region where the AGC chief is believed to have effectively created his own autonomous region in Nudo de Paramillo where the paramilitaries are now “lord and master” and unopposed by the military.The rise of the AGC, Colombia’s criminal powerhouseCollusionIn the northwestern Uraba region, Otoniel’s men are also in control in alleged collusion with the military, according to Monsignor Hugo Torres, the bishop of Apartado.The AGC are taking over the entire territory, so what is the task of the public forces? Second, around those rivers in the Atrato there is a lot of illicit crops. The army does not act. One ask: what is going on? and one says that there is collusion. The inhabitants say that there is a relationship between the one and the other.Bishop Hugo TorresThis accusation was also made in 2020 by Truth Commission member Leyner Palacios, who was a social leader from Choco, the Pacific province south of Uraba, at the time.The army vowed to investigate the accusation, but has yet to present any results.Colombia’s army vows to investigate alleged ties to AGC paramilitariesBeating around the bushPolice General Jorge Luis VargasDuque and his security chief appear to be using random operational results to conceal the fact that they don’t appear to be trying to fulfill the mission to kill or capture the AGC chief.According to the police chief, 49 alleged members of Otoniel’s paramilitary organization were killed and and another 648 arrested as part of Operation Agamenon so far this year.Vargas added that some 40 metric tons of cocaine allegedly belonging to the AGC were intercepted as part of the operation.Operation Agamenon has nothing to do with counternarcotics operations or fighting illegal armed groups, however.For almost 10 years, this operation has only had one mission, which was to to kill or capture Otoniel.Multiple government and media sources have said the AGC chief is in Nudo de Paramillo and, with the exception of not using his cellphone, appears to be as comfortable as he was 10 years ago.

" Army commanders appointed by Colombia’s President Ivan Duque are dragging the military through an almost endless slew of corruption scandals.The latest scandal involves General Jorge Eduardo Mora, the commander of the Special Forces Division, who is accused by eight of his subordinates of extortion.The National Army confirmed that Mora was being investigated after W Radio reported that the general was accused of ordering his subordinates to give him money obtained through fraud.The alleged extortion racketSoldiers of the Special Forces Division on a visit to the United States in 2019. (Image: US Army)According to weekly Semana, the subordinates were ordered to declare a minimum of $1,300 in monthly travel expenses (COP5 million) after the general took charge of the unit earlier this year.W Radio reported that these monthly quota hovered between $2,000 (COP8 million) and $2,600 (COP10 million).According to the soldiers, they were ordered to deposit their illegal income on the accounts of two superiors, Captain Martin Alfonso Garces and Sergeant Omar Augusto Osorio, or surrender the money in cash.Mora denied the accusations and accused another subordinate, Captain Jaime Mauricio Cendales, of extorting the soldiers without his knowledge.Second scandal this monthColonel Alexander AmadoThe investigation against the commander of the division in charge of combating illegal armed groups was opened days after the arrest of the director of the National Army’s family welfare agency, Colonel Alexander Amado.According to the prosecution, the colonel managed a drug trafficking ring that provided arms and ammunition to dissidents of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.The commander of the 4th Brigade, which is stationed in Medellin, was arrested in 2019 for his alleged role in a different armed trafficking ring.Later than year, the former commander of the National Army, retired General Nicasio Martinez was forced to step down for persecuting journalist who were revealing his alleged criminal practices.Colombia claims army colonel provided guerrillas with arms and explosivesDuque’s disastrous military appointmentsRetired General Nicacio MartinezEver since President Ivan Duque reorganized the military in December 2018, the National Army has been implicated in a slew of corruption scandals.“Operation Baton,” a 2017 counterintelligence operation that sought to identify corrupt elements in the military, found evidence that 16 general, 128 mid-level commander, 122 soldiers and 35 civilians were involved in one of multiple organized crime rackets after a three-year investigation.By then, however, Duque had appointed the allegedly corrupt former General Eduardo Quiros in charge of counterintelligence unit.Instead of getting rid of the allegedly corrupt officials, Quiros and his successor, General Gonzalo Garcia, allegedly embarked on a witch hunt to identify the “rats” until they too were fired in 2020.The scandals have plummeted the approval rating of the entire armed forces that historically enjoyed overwhelming public approval among Colombians.Armed Forces’ approval ratingFuture of army commander uncertain?General Eduardo ZapateiroAccording to W Radio, the National Army’s current commander, General Eduardo Zapateiro, would also be on his way out.Zapateiro and National Police Commander Jorge Luis Vargas have been blamed for the security forces’ disastrous response to anti-government protests in which more than 85 protesters were murdered earlier this year.The army general additionally appears to lack the leadership capabilities that would allow the National Army to combat increasingly violence illegal armed groups.Before assuming the leadership of the army in 2019, Zapateira was already accused of being complicit in the 1995 disappearance of the father of soccer star Juan Fernando Quintero and the 2004 assassination of a social leader.Uribe running out of military allies?Ironically, Duque reportedly seeks to replace the army chief with the brother of the most recently accused general, retired General Jorge Enrique Mora, who is close to the president’s alleged mafia patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.The retired general negotiated a peace deal with now-defunct FARC guerrillas between 2012, but has since turned against the peace process, claiming that the peace deal was a “mortal error” that benefited the now-defunct guerrilla group.Extradited Medellin mafia boss “Don Berna” has accused the elder of the Mora brothers of teaming up with his “Oficina de Envigado” to assassinate late Liberal Party presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan in 1989.Retired Police General Mauricio Santoyo, Uribe’s former security chief, last week submitted to the war crimes tribunal to clarify his involvement in war crimes after spending years in a US prison on drug trafficking charges. corruptionJorge Eduardo MoramilitaryNational Army ",https://colombiareports.com/army-corruption-colombias-new-internal-enemy/,Army corruption: Colombia’s new ‘internal enemy’?

" The United States House of Representatives passed a bill that banned American defense funds for the aerial spraying of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, in Colombia.The bill that was sponsored by Democratic House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez additionally bans possible US funds for arms and training of the National Police’s anti-riot unit ESMAD.Last but not least, the bill by the New York Democrat asked the Department of Defense (DoD) to inform US Congress every six months.Ocasio-Cortez specifically wanted the DoD to inform the US lawmakers on the human rights situation in Colombia and progress made in investigations into the mass killing of anti-government protesters earlier this year.The increased scrutiny from US Congress comes months after the human rights commission of the Organization of American States put the Duque regime on a watchlist for despots.Colombia’s far-right regime put on despot watch listDuque’s drug policy dead?The financial restrictions on aerial spraying of coca are a major blow for Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque, who has expressed his desire to resume the controversial strategy since taking office in 2018.In fact, the president has announced the resumption for seven times in April, despite fierce opposition against the counternarcotics even Duque’s own office called ineffective.Both the president and Defense Minister Diego Molano have remained quiet about any kind of counternarcotics strategy since then, however.Duque has consistently refused to implement a crop substitution strategy that is part of a peace process that has been fiercely rejected by the president’s Democratic Center party.The United Nations on Drugs and Crime announced that Colombia’s estimated cocaine production reached a record high in June after the Defense Minister had been boasting about record coca eradication by police.Throughout this year, police appear to have abandoned also this strategy, leaving the president and his defense minister without any coordinated counternarcotics policy.The ban on defense funds does not mean no US funds will be available for aerial spraying, according to defense expert Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America.A large chunk of the funding for the controversial strategy has always been provided by the US Department of State.Duque’s ‘chemical warfare’ against coca ‘fuel for more war’ in ColombiaDuque’s police killings problemOcasio-Cortez’s approved proposal to also block funding for ESMAD is another disappointment for Duque, but with little consequences.The US government wasn’t funding the riot police unit that Colombia’s opposition parties want dismantled.These called have become louder after evidence indicating that police murdered more than 50 people to quell anti-government protests that kicked off in April.The president has consistently defended the police while Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa has tried to downplay the number of people murdered by the cops.Whether the House bill will make it through the Senate it uncertain as the US government, with the support of Congress, has historically supported the aerial fumigation of coca despite the evidence the strategy is all but useless. aerial fumigationESMADforeign aidhuman rightsNational PoliceUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/us-house-blocks-funds-for-colombias-coca-spraying/,US House blocks defense funds for Colombia’s coca spraying

" Colombia’s government and Congress are trying to abolish an anti-corruption law less than six month before national elections.In its 2022 budget proposal bill, the government of authoritarian President Ivan Duque added a rider that would do away with so so-called Guarantees Law, which limits public spending in an election year.The economic commissions of both the Senate and the House of Representatives approved the budget proposal, including the rider on Wednesday.The Guarantees Law is arguably the most important piece of legislation to prevent the use of public funds for illegal campaign financing in Colombia.The approval of this article opens the door for the use of public funds, the taxes of all Colombians, for greasing the political machinery and the reelection of the traditional parties.House Representative Katherine MirandaColombia’s government promised peace funds to ‘grease palms’ for ‘coup’“Remember to put things in context”The president defended his government’s proposal to sink the Guarantees Law, urging “it’s important to remember to put things in context.”According to Duque, the fact that the president is not eligible for reelection would justify sinking a bill prevent fraud in all elections.The campaigns of congressmen are considerably more vulnerable to corruption than presidential campaigns because lawmakers need less votes to get elected.In Colombia there is no reelection, and since there is no reelection we have a different circumstance.President Ivan DuqueThe president additionally claimed that the ban on granting public contracts in an election year would slow down the government’s policy to recover from the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The congressional economic commissions agreed to “promote economic reactivation and job creation in the regions.”To prevent electoral corruption, the bill clarified that sinking the Guarantees Law should be accompanies by “more scrutiny and monitoring by control bodies.”The government has yet to propose a bill that would increase scrutiny on public spending.Colombia’s ICT minister resigns over corruption scandalPutting things into contextFormer ICT minister Karen Abudinen was forced to resign after media found out that government funds meant to connect rural areas to the internet had disappeared. (Image: ICT ministry)The Guarantees Law took force in 2005 to prevent the misallocation of public contracts to private companies that either support politician or are partially owned by them.These private firms and front companies have historically played a key role in electoral corruption by financing the campaigns of lawmakers in Congress, city councils and provincial assemblies.In some cases the public companies do not execute or finish the publicly financed projects while the government turns a blind eye.The Guarantees Law bans the granting public contracts in the six months before and six months after elections in an attempt to break this vicious election fraud cycle.The vicious election fraud cycle Is the government doing illegal stuff again?According to former Constitutional Court president Jose Gregorio Hernandez, the constitution doesn’t allow changes to electoral law through the approval of the government’s annual budget.Only a statutory law that is approved by the Constitutional Court would allow this, the judicial expert said on Twitter.Meanwhile, the government has come under pressure over the failure to effectively execute projects that were previously proposed by the Duque administration and approved by Congress.According to opposition Representative Katherine Miranda, contracts that received 56% of the government’s maintenance funds and 39% of investment funds were never executed. 2022 budget2022 electionselection fraudGuarantees Law ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-seeks-to-sink-anti-fraud-law-ahead-of-2022-elections/,Colombia seeks to sink anti-fraud law ahead of 2022 elections
" Locals from the town of Tulua found the victims of the ninth massacre in Colombia’s southwestern Valle del Cauca province on Sunday.The region around the city of Cali has been one of the hardest hit by a surge in massacres that has been registered throughout the country.Colombia’s Defense Ministry registered a 91% increase in massacres of four or more people between January and July compared to the same period last year.According to think tank Indepaz, 260 people were killed in 71 massacres of three and more people so far this year.Massacres in ColombiaThe surge in massacres appears to be due to increased violence in regions that have long been of strategic influence for illegal activity like drug trafficking and illegal mining, according to data provided by Indepaz.Massacre victims in 2021The situation in Valle del CaucaValle del Cauca has historically been of major importance for groups involved in moving cocaine from central Colombia to the country’s Pacific coast in the west.FARC dissident organization CCO, paramilitary group AGC and organized crime group La Oficina de Envigado are currently active in Tulua as well as local drug traffickers, according to Indepaz.The region around Tulua became a major drug trafficking hub in the mid-1990’s when the regional “Norte del Valle Cartel” was one of Colombia’s most powerful drug trafficking organizations.This cartel promoted the domestic production of cocaine instead of importing the illicit drugs from countries like Peru and Bolivia.The boom in the domestic cocaine production subsequently fueled violence between now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and the cartel’s partner, now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC.Authorities powerlessAuthorities have been unable to prevent the recent increase in massacres and other deadly violence that are causing a surge in homicides not seen in more than a decade.According the Medical Examiner’s Office, at least 8,566 were murdered between January and August, which is 26% more than in the same period last year and the highest number since 2013.Homicides between January and AugustThe government of President Ivan Duque has announced multiple strategies to combat deadly violence and organized crime since taking office in 2018, but without result. massacrespublic securityValle del Cauca ",https://colombiareports.com/southwest-colombia-shocked-by-yet-another-massacre/,Southwest Colombia shocked by yet another massacre
" Colombia’s mass media have been spreading disinformation over an allegedly growing public security crisis in the capital Bogota that is contradicted by local security statistics.Weekly Semana, which is close to the far-right government of President Ivan Duque, published multiple reports on the “wave of insecurity” in the “capital of fear” over the past few days.Semana claimed on Wednesday that “the critical insecurity situation in the country’s capital is reflected by official indicators,” which is false.Bogota security statistics indicate that reported crimes in the capital went down 24% in the first eight months of 2021 compares to the same period last year.Colombia’s television news: 16 minutes of apocalyptical horrorThe manipulation of Bogota’s inhabitantsLike Semana, other news outlets with close ties to the national government have repeatedly reported on armed robberies.Newspaper El Tiempo, another government-loyal publication, has published about individual crime incidents on a daily basis.Colombia’s two commercial television networks, RCN and Caracol, have illustrated their terrifying reports with CCTV footage presumably provided by the National Police.Amid the bombardment of apocalyptic news reports, Bogota residents’ insecurity perception has surged to a staggering 96%, a poll commissioned by Semana said last week.None of the government-loyal media have reported on the statistics that indicate the mass media were busier inducing mass hysteria than accurately reporting on the capital city’s actual security situation.Defense Minister Diego Molano, who is responsible for the police, used the fear generated by the media to justify the militarization of the capital.We are changing reality, not just perception. As of today, 360 soldiers of our army will be deployed in Bogota in coordinated actions with the Colombian Police.Defense Minister Diego MolanoBogota seeks military aid to confront crime wave in Colombia’s capitalBogota’s ‘crisis’ contradicting security statisticsA lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic triggered a collapse in reported crimes throughout Colombia, including the capital, in April last year.The number of reported crimes remained relatively low after the gradual reopening of Bogota compared to the period before the pandemic.Despite the apparent underreporting, nothing indicates that a “wave of insecurity” turned Bogota into Colombia’s “capital of fear” as claimed by Semana.Most prevalent crime rates dropReports of the most common crime in Bogota, army robbery, dropped almost 21% compared to 2019 when the residents of the capital reported a record number of 125,000 of these crimes.Robberies of commercial establishments dropped almost 59% compared to 2019 and also home invasions saw a significant drop over the past two years.Extortion also dropped slightly, according to Bogota’s Security Secretary. This is likely inaccurate because of the difficulties to report this racket that is run by both organized crime and illegal armed groups like paramilitary group AGC and guerrilla group ELN.The real threatThe expansion of these illegal armed groups in the south of Bogota one of the causes of homicides in the south of the capital, according to the Ombudsman’s Office.The Security Secretary registered 754 homicides between January in August, approximately 15% more than the 656 and 645 registered in 2019 and last year respectively.The Ombudsman’s Office warned about the growing threat posed by the illegal armed groups for the sixth time since 2018 in May.There is a presence of alleged members of paramilitary successor groups such as the self-styled AGC and the Aguilas Negras, and other illegal structures such as the Urban War Front of the ELN and militias that broke away or did not sign the agreements with the [now-defunct guerrilla group] FARC. In addition, the transfer and restructuring of members of armed organized crime groups like “Los Paisas”, “Los Orientales” (heirs of the Diablos del Cielo) and “Los Obispos.”Ombudsman’s OfficeDespite the warnings of Colombia’s top human rights agency and the data of the Security Secretary, the government-loyal media continued bombarding the people of Bogota with reports on violent crime.The media offensive fueled public discontent and sunk the public approval of Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez who failed to curb the mushrooming sense of insecurity fueled by the media.Fighting the judicial branch over an apparent ghost threatClaudia Lopez (Image: Twitter)Lopez, a long-time critic of the national government, called in the help of the defense minister on Monday to combat the capital’s “security crisis” and save her approval rating, which had dropped from 76% to 42% in a year.The mayor additionally supported Bogota Police Commander General Eliecer Camacho after he complained that only 500 of the 17,000 people arrested by his police department so far this year actually ended up in jail.In 2021, 17,000 people, of which 2,470 were foreign nationals, have been arrested for different reasons. Five hundred of these were taken into custody and between 75% and 80% were released during the process.Bogota Police General Eliecer CamachoLopez added she didn’t understand how it was possible that “the prosecution presents evidence and a judge doesn’t warrant the arrest.”Magistrate Juan Carlos Lopez of the Bogota Superior Tribunal responded that “the mayor’s statements ignore the constitutional grounds that demand of a judge to guarantee and respect the rights of citizens.”Bogota’s police department, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa and the defense minister had already been embarrassed on multiple occasions for hailing the arrest of alleged criminals who turned out to be innocent civilians.“Our Glorious National Army”(Image: Defense Minister)After Lopez’s former political allies began abandoning Bogota’s mayor over her decision to call in the military, the media loyal to Colombia’s far-right government on Thursday stepped up their offensive.Apart from replicating unsubstantiated claims made by government allies that the security situation in Bogota continued to get worse, weekly Semana began promoting calls on Lopez to resign.Other media loyal to the regime continued bombarding Bogota’s residents with reports on virtually every petty crime committed in the capital.Furthermore, military officials began explaining how the strengthened cooperation of “our glorious National Army” does not just seek to militarize Bogota, but other major cities in Colombia.

" Colombia’s prosecution is set to call the first policeman who allegedly was involved in the mass killing of anti-government protesters earlier this year to court, local media reported on Wednesday.According to newspaper El Espectador, suspended police major Jorge Mario Molano will face homicide charges for the murder of an anti-government protesters in Ibague, the capital of the Tolima province.The victim, Santiago Murillo, was murdered on May 2, allegedly by the cop who has denied this.Murillo was one of at least 77 anti-government protesters who were murdered in an apparent attempt to quell the mass protests that kicked off on April 28, according to human rights organizations.At least 47 of these murders were committed by cops, according to human rights organization Temblores, which has investigated the violence.Colombia clashes with OAS over damning human rights reportAccording to investigative journalism website Cuestion Publica, sources at the district prosecution in Cali said that they are close to calling extremist supporters of far-right President Ivan Duque to court.These reported court proceedings followed criminal charges pressed by human rights attorney Sebastian Caballero against Defense Minister Diego Molano, the National Police and Cali businessman Andres Escobar for their alleged involvement in kidnapping, torture, forced disappearances and murder.Cali’s district prosecution was only considering pursuing charges against civilians taking part in the attacks against participants in the protests that kicked off on April 28.Although it has not been possible to establish how many people would be covered by this decision of the 94th Prosecutor’s Office specialized in Human Rights, the crimes that they would consider charging the armed civilians with are: usurpation of functions and abuse of authority.Cuestion PublicaColombia accused of mass killing anti-government protestersSenator Ivan Cepeda also pressed criminal charges against Molano, claiming that the minister’s failure to condemn the attacks on protesters “in reality endorsed this new form of paramilitarism” in which government supporters attack and kill government opponents in collusion with police.Multiple videos have been recorded showing the use of firearms by armed civilians in the presence of police officers.Senator Ivan CepedaProsecutor General Francisco Barbosa, one of the president’s best friends, did not confirm the reports.The chief prosecutor downplayed the violence before the human rights commission of the Organization of American States (OAS) earlier this month after the Duque administration was put on a watchlist for despots.Will Colombia get away with police crimes against humanity?A special committee of the OAS’ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has been following up on progress to effectively try and punish those who took part in the mass killing of protesters.Following the instruction of a congressional committee, the US government may cut aid for Colombia’s National Police if Barbosa fails to effectively prosecute and punish those responsible for the state terror campaign. human rightsNational Policenational strikepolice brutality ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-set-to-prosecute-mass-killing-of-anti-government-protesters-reports/,Colombia set to prosecute mass killing of anti-government protesters: reports
" The mayor of Colombia’s capital Bogota wants to deploy some 2,000 Military Police officers to help curb a surge in violent crime.Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez announced she would seek military assistance to improve security after a meeting with authoritarian business association Fenalco.The mayor said that “the militarization of Bogota” was “ruled out,” and stressed that the military would only be deployed in joint patrols with local police “in critical areas” and disarmament operations.These critical areas would cover more than half of the capital, according to local media.Lopez additionally said that she supported a plan coined by the far-right government of President Ivan Duque to incorporate private security firms in “security fronts.”The Ministry of Defense recognizes that Bogotá needs 10,000 additional police. But it will only allocate 1,500 more this year. That’s why we believe that a concrete and useful short-term support is for it to assign some 2,000 military police to patrol and seize weapons in conjunction with the Bogota Police.Bogota Mayor Claudia LopezAccording to television network Caracol, experts said that members of the Military Police are not allowed to use force against civilians.They can, however, “set up checkpoints and, without a doubt, respond to imminent criminal acts against citizens,” military expert Javier Rincon of the Javeriana University told Caracol.The idea was supported by business leaders and supporters of the Duque administration, but opposed by members of the opposition in the Bogota city council and Congress.“Our concern is that this measure may increase the violation of human rights and although it not called militarization, it does represent a militarization of the city,” opposition councilor Heidy Sanchez told RCN Radio.Bogota’s police and the National Army have been under fire over the excessive use of force against civilians against anti-government protests in recent years.Colombia’s prosecution in no rush to seek justice for Bogota Massacre victimsLike many of Colombia’s cities, Bogota has seen a sharp increase in violent crime after the COVID-19 pandemic caused the worst economic collapse in recorded history.Homicides in the capital went up 15.7% in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2020, according to council member Emel Rojas.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque on Tuesday called the United Nations’ General Assembly for an international response to the coronavirus pandemic.In his last address to world leaders, Duque praised his government’s response to the pandemic, but deplored a lack of international cooperation in the mass vaccination against Covid-19.The president claimed that his government’s response to a surge in unemployment and poverty triggered by the pandemic was “the most ambitious social agenda of this century and, perhaps, our history.”According to Duque, the government would maintain its $45/month stipend for the poor until December next year “to reach “more than four million vulnerable household, offering direct financial support to more than 25% of our entire population.”The president additionally praised his government’s subsidy on the salaries of newly hired workers, despite the fact that less than 15,000 companies have take part in the program that was supposed to create 500,000 jobs.In order to overcome the health crisis, the president called for a multinational approach to the mass vaccination of citizens, which has suffered major delays in Colombia.If delays are maintained in the equitable distribution of vaccines to all nations, we expose ourselves as humanity to new variables that may attack us with greater ferocity. Global immunity requires solidarity so that there is no hoarding by some in the face of the needs of others.President Ivan DuqueDuque reiterated his government’s goal to have vaccinated more than 35 million people before the end of the year.Since February, health authorities have vaccinated a little more than 16 million people, mainly due to shortages in vaccines.The president said that the humanitarian effects of the coronavirus pandemic in Colombia were aggravated by mass migration from the neighboring country Venezuela.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque said Saturday that five soldiers were killed and six were injured in a guerrilla attack in a rural region controlled by the ELN.The attack allegedly took place in Arauquita, a town in the northeastern Arauca province that borders Venezuela.According to Duque, the “cowardly terrorist attack” would “clearly” be an “action between the ELN and dissidents of the FARC planned from Venezuela.”The president provided no evidence to sustain his claim that the ELN and FARC dissidents joined forces for what would be their first joint offensive operation.Ever since taking office in 2018, Duque has made multiple false or unfounded claims to sustain theories of a conspiracy between the ELN, rival FARC dissident groups and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.ELN goes diplomatic as Colombia and Venezuela bicker over border securityThe commander of the Armed Forces, General Luis Fernando Navarro, did not confirm the president’s latest conspiracy theory, but did announce a $166,000 (COP637 million) reward for information that would lead to the arrest of ELN ringleader “Nacho” and “Arturo,” an alleged FARC dissident.The top military commander additionally reiterated that there were outstanding rewards for ELN ringleader “Culebra,” one of the leading guerrilla commanders in the Arauca province, and FARC dissident leader Fredy.Navarro additionally announced that he would reinforce security in Arauca, an ELN stronghold, with an additional 300 soldiers, and would step up military operations that seek to weaken the guerrillas in the remote region.The guerrilla attack is one of the most aggressive offensives in the region since February last year when the group ordered a three day shutdown in guerrilla territories and went carried out several attacks.Why the ELN embarked on its three-day terror campaign, according to the guerrillasSince then, the group has maintained a relatively defensive strategy until August when a bomb attack outside a police station in the northeastern city of Cucuta injured 10 policemen and 2 civilians.Following the demobilization of the FARC in 2017, groups formed by dissidents or rearmed guerrillas have refrained from carrying out high profile attacks.The majority of FARC dissident groups have not been able to recover the military prowess that would allow the guerrillas to confront the military.In the border region around Arauca, the ELN and rearmed members of the FARC’s former 10th Front have upheld what appears to be a non-aggression pact.

" Poverty in Quibdo soared to the point that three in 10 people in the city in west Colombia are trying to live off less than $39 (COP149,000) a month last year.According to a study by the Red de Ciudades Como Vamos, the economic crisis that followed the coronavirus pandemic had a devastating impact on poverty in all Colombia’s provincial capitals.Nowhere, however, did the poverty rate reach the level of the capital of the Choco province where 66% of the 131,000 residents found themselves living below the poverty line in 2020.Only one third of Quibdo’s residents had a monthly income that was higher than $106 (COP407,000), according to the Red de Ciudades Como Vamos.More than 86 thousand people earned less than the municipal poverty line. Of these people, almost 40,000 found themselves living in extreme poverty and on the brink of starvation.Quibdo’s income levelsLocals are not just suffering from extreme poverty, “but the lack of access to health, education, decent work and adequate infrastructure in the homes,” according to the Red de Ciudades.The latter became painfully evident on Saturday when a a three-year-old girl died in a fire caused by a shortcut.(Image: Choco Governor’s Office)Government failuresPresident Ivan Duque’s efforts to reactivate Colombia’s economy after the worst collapse in recorded history has had little effect, especially in the capital of Choco.Duque traveled to Quibdo in January to present his “Compromise for Colombia” economic reactivation strategy.According to the president’s special regional advisor, Ana Marua Palau, Choco was a “priority province for the government” that would receive a $133 million investment “to implement reactivation projects.”Since then, Quibdo’s unemployment rate rose to 21.9% between April and June compared to 20% between November last year and January, according to statistics agency DANE.The Inspector General’s Office warned Mayor Martin Sanchez last month that his government had left some 34,000 without school lunches from a month.The School Food Program couldn’t have been more important as it seeks to curb malnutrition among Colombia’s poorest children.Starve obedientlyViolence by illegal armed groups has made it increasingly difficult for locals to speak out about the deteriorating situation in Quibdo, psychologist Haidy Sanchez said in an editorial in newspaper El Tiempo last month.There have been approximately 83 homicides so far this year, endless homicide attempts, rampant robberies, threatening and intimidating pamphlets with a defiant tone by criminal gangs that give the feeling you can’t express an opinion about the situation regarding government control or the current social decomposition in the city, because one could be the target of threats.Psychologist Haidy SanchezTwo weeks after Sanchez reported 83 homicides, social leader Darwin Lozano said Thursday that the number of murder victims had gone up to 93.According to Colombia’s human rights office, leftist ELN guerrillas, right-wing AGC paramilitaries and two local criminal organizations are vying for control over Quibdo.Locals protests against the recent violence on Thursday last week.

" A court convicted two more former aides of Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe for taking part in a criminal organization that operated from the presidential palace.The Bogota Superior Tribunal sentenced Uribe’s former press secretary Cesar Velasquez and former judicial secretary Edmundo del Castillo to more than five year imprisonment on Wednesday.A 2015 Supreme Court sentence indicated that the criminal organization that operated from inside the presidential palace was led by Uribe’s former chief of staff, Bernardo Moreno.Moreno and multiple former intelligence officials were already convicted for the slew of crimes committed to derail investigations into politicians with ties to the AUC, and bribes paid to lawmakers by two of Uribe’s ministers.The court found that Del Castillo and Velasquez were not involved in all the crimes committed by the criminal organization led by Uribe’s chief of staff.The intention of the ex-officials was not to protect the institutionality, but to tarnish the image of the magistrates.Bogota Superior TribunalThe presidential mafiaThe Supreme Court ordered Congress to investigate Uribe’s alleged possible role as the mastermind of the criminal organization that operated from the presidential palace.The court also ordered investigations into Senator Jose Obdulio Gaviria, the cousin of late drug lord Pablo Escobar and Uribe’s presidential adviser at the time whose name popped up in multiple of the investigations.The presidential palace mafia suspectsDel Castillo and Velasquez’ crimesThe DAS wiretapping

human rights organizations, journalists and opposition lawmakers who were also investigating the ties between the paramilitaries and the politicians, including Uribe.Del Castillo subsequently used this information to fabricate criminal allegations against these organizations and people that were promoted by Velasquez in government-loyal media.DAS wiretapping scandalFabricating ties between Supreme Court and mafiaUribe’s chief of staff also involved Gaviria, Del Castillo and Velasquez in the so-called “Case Trip,” which sought to fabricate claims that a Supreme Court trip to the city of Neiva had been financed by a business associate of drug trafficker “Chepe Ortiz.”Del Castillo leaked this information to the Financial Intelligence Unit in order to trigger a criminal investigation while Velasquez leaked the fabricated scandal to Caracol Radio and Hurtado got Spanish columnist Salud Hernandez involved, according to multiple former DAS executives.Colombia’s mafia and the media |

Supreme Court magistrate Ivan Velasquez, the main “parapolitics” investigator.Job was assassinated in Medellin in 2008 after journalists revealed the illegal meeting that allegedly was also attended by Gaviria.The Guzman caseDel Castillo asked the Prosecutor General’s Office to investigate Supreme Court magistrates in October 2007 after receiving documents from the consulate in New York in which former paramilitary fighter claimed he had been offered bribes.Five days later, Velasquez prepared a press release on the claim, which the press secretary first sent to the DAS director, allegedly to justify a secret investigation into the magistrates.The press release and the classified information were leaked to public news network Canal Uno.Also in this case, the court did not find enough evidence for a conviction.The Tasmania hoax“Tasmania”Uribe was personally involved in a conspiracy to discredit the Supreme Court’s main parapolitics investigator with the help of the DAS and Semana director Vicky Davila in 2008.According to the DAS convicted director, the conspiracy sought to discredit Velasquez after opening investigation against the former president’s cousin, convicted Senator Mario Uribe, on September 26.Hurtado told the court that Uribe immediately ordered his intelligence chief to investigate the magistrate. Moreno additionally ordered her to pick up a letter in Medellin on September 29, according to the former DAS chief.DAS agent Marta Leal confirmed this and on October 1 met the driver of Uribe’s cousin gave her a letter in which a demobilized paramilitary fighter, “Tasmania,” claimed the Supreme Court magistrate had offered him bribes.Velasquez discovered the conspiracy, however, and filed criminal charges on October 4.Uribe and his allies refused to give up, however, and called in the help of “El Tuso,” one of the Uribe family’s drug trafficking associates.El Tuso helped prep the former paramilitary fighter for a scripted interview with Semana director Vicky Davila, who worked at La FM at the time, on October 6.The former president’s press secretary confirmed the false accusations in an October 8 press release.El Tuso and Tasmania admitted in November that the whole thing was a hoax in November, which was later confirmed by multiple DAS officials and helped get Uribe’s former chief of staff in prison.

" Southwest Colombia was the world’s most dangerous place for environmental activists in 2020, based on data revealed by human rights NGO Global Witness.According to the NGO’s annual report on deadly violence against activists, almost 30% of the 227 assassinated environmental activists worldwide were murdered in Colombia.Of the 65 assassinations registered in the South American country last year, 28 took place in the southwestern provinces of Cauca, Nariño and Valle del Cauca.Intensity of violence against environmental activistsParticularly in southwest Colombia, indigenous communities trying to defend their ancestral lands bore the brunt of the violence.Forty-one of the 65 assassinations throughout the country were associated with the defense of land against both legal and illegal economic activity.The victims of 17 of the registered assassinations were actively involved in a government program that seeks to replace coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, for legal crops.Seven assassinated leaders were actively opposing legal oil and mining projects, industrial agriculture and infrastructure projects.According to Colombian human rights NGO Somos Defensores, the increased violence against environmental activists in Colombia reflects the increase registered by Global Witness around the globe.In 2020 we saw a 15% increase in attacks and a 60% increase in murders. We observed two elements of this increase. One is that while we were all confined to our homes, it seems that the aggressors had more freedom to act as they pleased throughout the national territory. And a second element is that isolation made it easier to locate and identify these leaders precisely because they remained in their homes. Several of the homicides we registered took place precisely in the places of residence of the leaders.Somos Defensores coordinator Lourdes CastroThe increased violence against environmental activists last year was part of a broader trend of violence targeting all kinds of community leaders and activists.According to human rights NGO Indepaz, 2020 was the deadliest year for social leaders since the beginning of a peace process between the government and now-defunct guerrilla group FARC. environmenthuman rightssocial leaders ",https://colombiareports.com/southwest-colombia-worlds-most-dangerous-place-for-environmental-activists-report/,Southwest Colombia world’s most dangerous place for environmental activists: report

" The former leaders of the Cali Cartel accused Colombia’s former President Andres Pastrana of blackmailing them into accusing his predecessor of corruption.Pastrana last week published a letter in which Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez claimed that former President Ernesto Samper knew in 1994 that the drug cartel was funding his campaign.In a letter to the media, the extradited drug lords said Pastrana got the Rodriguez brothers to sign off on the letter through “vulgar blackmail” that allegedly took place in 2000.According to the Cali Cartel founders, the former president’s personal physician visited the drug lords in prison and, “on behalf of Pastrana,” said they would be extradited to the United States unless they signed off on the letter.The Rodriguez brothers said that the letter was never meant to made public, but to silence Samper over corruption scandals that were embarrassing Pastrana.Pastrana was one of the main critics of his liberal predecessor whose former Defense Minister was imprisoned for receiving money from the Cali Cartel in 1994.At the same time, however, Samper’s conservative rival found himself embarrassed over bribes paid to Pastrana’s allies to grant government contracts to dredging firm Dragacol.A year after Pastrana’s 1998 election, his Conservative Party government entered in crisis over a corruption investigation that forced Development Minister Fernando Araujo to resign.The extradited drug lords accused Pastrana of blackmail and abusing a “serious and respectable” institution like the Truth Commission “to accuse someone less corrupt than you.”Pastrana has long been considered Colombia’s worst president in history as the corruption crises, the worst economic collapse in history until the coronavirus crisis and escalating violence almost converted the country into a failed state.The reputation of the dynasty politician sunk even lower after media revealed Pastrana traveled on the “Lolita Express,” the private airplane used by late US financier Jeffrey Epstein for sex parties with minors.

" Colombia’s chief prosecutor is desperately trying to sweep evidence of the assassinations of least 44 anti-government protesters by police under the rug.In a report to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), human rights NGO Temblores presented evidence that would prove police committed mass murder in an apparent attempt to quell the protests that were held earlier this year.The NGO said that it was still verifying possible police involvement in the killing of another 11 protesters of the 72 who were assassinated while taking part in the massive protests.The IACHR is investigating the crimes against humanity committed by the police and armed supporters of the increasingly tyrannical government of President Ivan Duque.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa claimed that his office only knew of 57 murders that took place during the protests.Twenty-eight of these murdered would be unrelated to the protests, according to Barbosa, who said that his office had only identified the involvement of police in five homicides.Another 16 were allegedly committed by civilians and one by an indigenous protester who Barbosa apparently doesn’t consider a civilian.In an apparent attempt of to divert attention away from the mass human rights violations committed by the police, the chief prosecutor stressed that he had opened 11 criminal investigations into the alleged involvement of four criminal organization in violent incidents that took place during the largely peace protests.The protesters may not have engaged in crimes against humanity like the police, but they had violated other citizens’ rights to the freedom of movement, health, work and whatnot.The IACHR additionally asked about the authorities’ follow-up on the IACHR’s recommendations that would prevent more human rights violations by the disgraced government, which ordered its first police massacre to quell protests against police brutality that erupted in the capital Bogota in September last year.

" Colombia’s government coalition went in overdrive on Tuesday to approve a tax reform that triggered massive anti-government protests in April.The vote was boycotted by the opposition, which claimed that amendments proposed by them were ignored and lawmakers didn’t have time to properly study or debate the bill.A watered down reformThe reform will generate almost $4 billion (COP15.2 trillion) in taxes to help finance the 2022 government budget, according to Finance Minister Jose Manuel Restrepo.The initial reform proposal sought $6.5 billion (COP25 trillion) in tax revenue, but was withdrawn by President Ivan Duque and spurred the resignation of former Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla in May amid the protests.Restrepo presented the second draft in July and expressed hope the bill would make it through Congress before September, which is when lawmakers formally begin campaigning for the 2022 elections.Colombia presents new tax reform ahead of new protestsHow to rush a bill through CongressLawmakers initially sought 180 amendments to the bill of which almost 80 were reportedly added to the government proposal ahead of Tuesday’s vote.Senators and house representatives were called to Congress to vote on the tax reform between 4PM and 5PM and Monday, according to opposition lawmakers.Sixteen hours later, both chambers began parallel debates and approved the bill in a vote that was boycotted by the opposition.Because the Senate and the House approved two different versions of the tax reform, a reconciliation commission will vote on a final version on Thursday.The specifics of the tax reform were not immediately known to the public because of the speed with which the bill was pushed through Congress.The reform will take effect one the president signs off on the bill after which the Constitutional Court will study whether the bill and the way it was rushed through Congress are constitutional.The latter is no formality as the high court in 2019 ruled that Congress violated the constitution in its rush to approve the government’s 2018 tax reform. 2022 budgettax reform ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-congress-approves-tax-reform-in-top-speed/,Colombia’s congress approves tax reform in top speed
" Some of Colombia’s leading scholars are proposing revolutionary policy changes that would allow the recovery of the country’s failed state and stagnating economy from the coronavirus pandemic.Multiple economists have been coming up with previously unthinkable policy proposals that could lift the country out of a previously unthinkable crisis.Mateo Hoyos of the elite university Los Andes from Bogota urged to abandon traditional liberal economics and renegotiate existing free trade agreements (FTA’s) with for example the United States and the European Union.This would allow Colombia to develop a competitive economy instead of reactivating an economic system that was never catching up with developed nations in the first place, according to the economist.It’s impossible to overcome poverty and get out of the reverse if the FTAs are not renegotiated. It is not possible to develop the country, increase its income and end poverty without an industry. And for that the FTAs are a hindrance, a detriment.Mateo HoyosHoyos slammed the “libertarian” ideas that promote a laissez faire approach to reactivate the economy.Libertarian economics “is pernicious and contrary to the objective… of overcoming poverty,” according to the economist.There is nothing more misguided in development policy than to idolize “free competition.” It is a statement that contradicts science, and opposes the conclusions of scholars in economic development and history.Mateo HoyosHoyos apparently argued for a contemporary version of the economics of legendary economic John Maynard Keyens, stressing that “the State must intervene” if Colombia wants to reactivate its economy in a way that would allow the country to catch up with developed economies.To support his opinion, the economist cited a 2020 study carried out at the British Oxford University publication of three Italian economists coined policies that seek “market-friendly policies; industrial policies targeting the development of firms’ capabilities and R&D investments, as well as trade restrictions for infant industry protection; protectionist policies focusing on tariffs only” that would allow “laggard countries” to “catch up with leaders.”We find that markets cannot do the magic: in absence of government interventions, laggards will continue to fall behind.Economists Giovanni Dosi, Andrea Roventini and Emanuele RussoHoyos stressed that “development is nothing easy.” Resorting only to protectionist policies like the imposition of trade tariffs and subsidies alone “is not enough.”“These and other tools must be used intelligently and accurately,” according to the economists.The last thing Colombia’s government should do is stick to traditional liberal economic dogmas as to “to say that what is needed is a free market is not only false but also immobilizing.” economic reactivationeconomyFree TradeFTAMateo Hoyosnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/scholars-drastic-solutions-for-colombia-part-1-renegotiating-free-trade/,Scholars’ drastic solutions for Colombia | Part 1: renegotiating free trade

The prosecution has apparently failed to effectively investigate other policemen and commander allegedly involved in the massacre.The failure to investigate impeded to establish the alleged responsibility in the massacre of President Ivan Duque, Defense Minister Diego Molano, Interior Minister Daniel Palacios and the top of the military.The commanders of the security forces and Duque’s closest aides coordinated the brutal response to the uprising that followed the brutal murder of Javier Ordoñez.One of the cops who murdered Ordoñez, Juan Camilo Lloreda, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.Colombia’s defense minister leaves evidence of orchestrating terrorism onlineA prelude to terrorLocals from told Noticias in December last year that they felt forced to leave Verbenal, one of the neighborhoods where local cops allegedly murdered civilians.We’re going to have to move because we’re suffering a lot of police harassment since they killed our brother.

" Colombia’s police on Saturday detained a senior drug trafficker for allegedly laundering money for the Sinaloa Cartel.According to local media, Nestor Tarazona was reportedly arrested near Pereira, the capital of the Risaralda province and one of the cities where the senior drug lord allegedly laundered money for the Mexican cartel.Colombia’s authorities did not publicly confirm the arrest of the senior crime lord with ties to family members of former President Alvaro Uribe and Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez.Whether Tarazona was jailed after his latest arrest is unclear.Elusive careerAccording to newspaper El Tiempo, Tarazona has been linked to drug trafficking since the 1980’s but primarily known for the breeding and trading of horses.The narco was first arrested on drug trafficking charges in 1989 in the United States and sentenced to prison after a second arrest in 1990.Tarazona was released and repatriated to Colombia in 1995, after which the narco resumed his criminal activities from the central Colombian Meta province, according to the US Treasury Department.At one point, Tarazona moved to Mexico, according to US authorities and transnational crime website InSight Crime.Despite being convicted of drug trafficking and accused of money laundering in 2009, the narco apparently had no difficulty traveling between Colombia, Mexico and the United States where he was arrested again in 2012.Curiously, the Treasury Department’s removed the narco from its so-called Kingpin List and Colombia’s prosecution opened an investigation against Tarazona the same year.The narco went off the radar after shutting down one of his businesses in Colombia in 2013, investigative journalist Martha Elvira Soto said in her 2014 book “Cocaine Horses.”Alleged government tiesTarazano is one of multiple narcos with ties to both the Sinaloa Cartel and the Colombian government, specifically Colombia’s vice-president and Uribe, another horse breeder.While in Mexico, police seized a 26-ton cocaine shipment meant for the narco and arranged by “Memo Fantasma, a jailed business partner of Martinez’s husband, according to InSight Crime.Tarazano’s front companies in Colombia were reportedly part of a Sinaloa Cartel money laundering network that was largely controlled by the Cifuentes Clan of Uribe’s fugitive niece and her convicted mother, who had two children with the former president’s late brother.During his elusive career, the mafioso created money laundering companies throughout Colombia. cifuentes villa clandrug traffickingMemo Fantasma ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-arrests-sinaloa-cartel-money-laundering-chief/,Colombia arrests ‘Sinaloa Cartel money laundering chief’
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque triggered a resurgence of anti-government sentiment on Tuesday by appointing his loathed former finance chief to the central bank’s board of directors.Former Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla resigned in May after his tax reform proposal triggered massive protests in which dozens were killed by police.Duque’s announcement triggered calls on social media to renew protests that had all but died out, four months after they initially kicked off on April 28.Duque once again is rewarding those who make mistakes and, in addition, taking over the board of the issuer.Economy reporter Paola HerreraThe president was expected to appoint a replacement after the central bank’s longest-sitting director, Carolina Soto, resigned on Friday.Soto’s husband, former Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria, said his wife wanted to avoid a conflict of interest while the Liberal Party politician ran for president.The resignation allowed Duque to appoint a replacement to the board, which will consist of government allies for the first time in the history of the central bank, which is supposed to be independent.Colombia’s central bank at risk of government takeoverWhy Carrasquilla ruined itAlberto Carrasquilla (C) celebrating his illegally approved tax reform in 2018.

" Homicides in Buenaventura have surged amid the latest turf war over who controls the Pacific port city with one of Colombia’s largest shipping container terminals.Buenaventura’s authorities reportedly counted 123 homicides in the port city that processes approximately 40% of Colombia’s imports and exports so far this year.Violence not seen in more than a decadeHow many bodies of people who disappeared have been dumped in the mangroves and rivers that surround Buenaventura is unknown.The most recent numbers are from April when authorities said that 13 people had been reported missing in the first three months of this year.More than 100 people were driven out of their homes in the past week alone as the illegal armed groups are subjecting Buenaventura to levels of violence the locals haven’t seen in more than a decade.Homicides in BuenaventuraCorrupt authoritiesLocal youth took to the streets on Saturday to reject the latest wave of violence that has victimized approximately 80% of the city during decades of government neglect and corruption.The protests surged despite claims by the police chief of the Valle del Cauca province, Colonel Jorge Urquijo, who said a week before that more than 260 alleged gang members from Buenaventura have been arrested and more than 4,000 kilos of cocaine have been seized in the port city so far this year.These alleged results fail to improve security in Buenaventura as corruption appears to be undoing efforts to effectively enforce the law.A customs official who was arrested in March for allegedly moving cocaine into the container terminal, for example, had apparently gone back to work after his arrest on money laundering charges in 2019.President Ivan Duque in April announced the arrest of a former customs executive, but forgot to mention that also this official had already been arrested, but released in 2020.The prosecution apparently failed to press criminal charges against the customs chief who laundered more than $1.3 million in drug money, according to the FBI.Three agents of police intelligence agency DIJIN were arrested in Buenaventura the same month for allegedly stealing seized cocaine.Suspicious chemicalsBuenaventura’s port is one of Colombia’s biggest hubs, including for the legal import of chemicals used for the production of cocaine and crack.Some 75% of Colombia’s export licenses for hydrochloric acid, a chemical used to produce cocaine, are issued by the Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Buenaventura SA (SPRB), the company that runs the city’s port.The same firm facilitates the import of more than 30% of Colombia’s imports of sodium bicarbonate, which is used to turn cocaine into crack.SPRB vowed to inform authorities about suspicious trading in these substances through a “voluntary cooperation agreement” signed with Justice Minister Wilson Ruiz last month.This agreement for the Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Buenaventura implies we show our customers that in this terminal the safety of their cargo is among our priorities, as well as the efficiency in our productivity rates.SPRB General manager Yahaira DíazA mafia government?(Image: Paz y Reconciliacion)The gangs have been subjecting Buenaventura to terror amid growing unrest about the devastating consequences of government corruption and neglect.According to a 2020 study by the city government, 82% of the port city’s resident were living in extreme poverty, of which 41% were virtually on the street.According to the local Chamber of Commerce, this would be partly due to the fact that 30% of Buenaventura’s population was unemployed last year.Colombia’s failing state | Part 2: who is the boss in Buenaventura?“Corporation steals children’s food”Comptroller General Carlos Felipe Cordoba announced a preliminary investigations into the government contractor that is supposed to  provide school meals to some 45,000 of Buenaventura’s poor children last month last month“It isn’t right they don’t provide our kids with what they need for their nutrition,” said Cordoba 10 months after the Inspector General ‘s Office warned that the children were not given without the proteins necessary for their development.These irregularities would be the responsibility of some NGO managed by Bogota food manufacturer Agrobolsa, which got its first  $2.2 million contract from the jailed former mayor to feed the city’s children for half a year.Government scheme left Buenaventura without waterSeventy percent of the city was left without running water in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year because Hidropacífico, the government contractor that was paid to maintain the city’s water supply for 18 years, spent the budget on other things.In order to provide the city with drinking water anyway, the city took part in a dodgy financial scheme of incoming central bank chief Alberto Carrasquila, which allowed the city to borrow $11.4 million the construct pipelines.The majority of these pipelines were never built, but the scheme did leave the city hall with a $61.1 million debt.(Image: Paz y Reconciliacion)Four years after the people of Buenaventura rose up against the government corruption despite the paramilitary oppressions, and shut down the port to force the government to stop robbing them, the Duque administration appears to insist on doing exactly that

" Colombia’s prosecution is set to indict the country’s former army chief on 104 murder charges on Wednesday before an ordinary court instead of the war crimes tribunal.The decision is controversial as only the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) is allowed to try alleged war criminals as part of a 2016 peace deal with now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.The prosecution wants to indict retired General Mario Montoya before the Bogota Superior Tribunal, however.The JEP has been investigating General Mario Montoya since 2018 for the retired army general’s alleged role in the mass execution of civilians who were reported as combat kills.According to the war crimes tribunal, the security forces’ reported at least 6,400 of these “false positives” between 2002 and 2008 when the practice caused a scandal.Montoya allegedly was one of the main promotors of the war crimes committed by the army practice and is the highest ranking official to be indicted for the “false positives.”How Colombia’s former army chief is drowning in his own buckets of bloodThe JEP ordered the Prosecutor General’s Office to proceed with ongoing criminal investigations, but banned calling war crime suspects who submitted to the war crimes tribunal to court.The Constitutional Court, however, never explicitly defined at which point prosecutors are supposed to surrender the results of concluded criminal investigations to the JEP.The prosecution “invited” Montoya to his indictment as if this wasn’t compulsory, the former army chief’s defense attorney, Andres Garzon, told newspaper El Espectador.The Bogota Superior Tribunal — where Montoya will be indicted — can’t legally try the former army chief, however.Montoya’s attorney already said that he would challenge the indictment before the Constitutional Court.This high court is likely to end the judicial insecurity and define how the prosecution must proceed after concluding the investigation of war crimes, according to judicial experts.The controversial former general has categorically denied any responsibility for the mass killing of civilians. false positivesJEPMario MontoyaProsecutor General's Office ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-former-army-chief-facing-2nd-mass-murder-trial/,Colombia’s former army chief facing 2nd mass murder trial
" Five years after the 1st Front of the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC announced its opposition to Colombia’s peace process, this dissident group has consolidated control in the east of the country.The “Eastern Coordinating Command” (CCO) that was subsequently formed by dissident FARC commanders “Ivan Mordisco” and “Gentil Duarte” have had relatively little trouble curbing the expansion of the “Nueva Marquetalia.”This group was formed in 2019 by the FARC’s political leader, “Ivan Marquez,” but has only been able to consolidate control over rearming guerrillas in the northwestern Antioquia province, according to a study by the Paz y Reconciliacion Foundation (Pares).Both groups appear to be vying for control in southwest Colombia by absorbing groups formed by independent FARC dissidents and rearmed guerrillas.The CCO, Nueva Marquetalia and the independent dissidents expanded their activity to 138 municipalities, which is half of the area controlled by the FARC until their demobilization and disarmament in 2017.This expansion would largely be due to the recruitment of a new guerrillas and financed by drug trafficking.A new generation of guerrillasOf the 13,999 former FARC guerrillas who signed up for the reintegration program that is part of the peace process, 13,139 continue to take part, according to the most recent government report.At least 280 former FARC members were assassinated during the peace process, which implies that some 580 abandoned the peace process and could have joined dissident groups in the past four years.Pares confirmed that the vast majority of members of the groups formed by dissidents of the peace process are new recruits.The think tank did not speculate about the number of members of these post-FARC groups.MINGA! | Part 2: Colombia’s indigenous vs narco-guerrillasControl over southwest ColombiaBoth CCO and Nueva Marquetalia, which has only been able to consolidate control over rearmed guerrillas in Antioquia and Cordoba, are vying for control over the southwest of Colombia.In this part of the country, FARC dissidents and rearmed guerrillas initially operated independently in an apparent alliance with Mexican drug trafficking groups mainly in the provinces of Nariño, Cauca and Valle del Cauca.The groups of Mordisco, Duarte and Marquez have been trying to use their growing influence to absorb these groups in their own organizations, but with mixed success.While some of the groups in southwest Colombia have aligned themselves with CCO and Nueva Marquetalia, others continue to refuse to take orders from the leading successors of the FARC.The resistance of these independent groups, and the rivalry between CCO and Nueva Marquetalia, has prevented the formation of a single FARC heir that operates nationally, according to Pares.Colombia’s defense minister in trouble over guerrilla conspiracy theoriesIncreasingly politicalThe main source of revenue of all FARC dissident groups is the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine.The municipalities that are effectively controlled by the different FARC dissident groups are home to more than 85% of Colombia’s coca cultivations.Despite all groups’ reliance on the lower echelons of the drug trade, the growing power of the CCO and Nueva Marquetalia is increasingly politicizing the FARC dissidents.The CCO has been citing political motivations not to take part in the peace process since the group split from the FARC in 2016, and Nueva Marquetalia cited political reasons to abandon the peace process in 2019.The two groups’ increasing influence in southwest Colombia is also politicizing the dissident groups formed there in many cases for strictly criminal purposes.This politicization is fueled by the government’s failure to comply with the peace deal that allowed the demobilization and disarmament of the FARC.The internal rivalry is preventing any of the groups to convincingly claim to be continuing the FARC’s decades-long war with the State and “the oligarchy,” however. armed conflictFARC dissidentsnewsletterNueva MarquetaliaSoutheastern Bloc ",https://colombiareports.com/farc-dissidents-seek-consolidation-in-southwest-colombia/,FARC dissidents seek consolidation in southwest Colombia
" Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe on Monday testified before the Truth Commission about war crimes committed when the far-right politician was head of state.From his estate in Rionegro, the former president dismissed the legitimacy of the Truth Commission that is part of a peace process Uribe and his far-right Democratic Center party have fiercely opposed.The political patron of President Ivan Duque said he agreed to testify as part of his “commitment to contribute to the truth” despite his refusal to “recognize institutions that formed” as part of a 2016 peace deal between now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos.The former president denied any responsibility for the surge in paramilitary death squads when Uribe was governor of his native Antioquia province and the extrajudicial executions of at least 6,400 people dead by members of the military when the far-right leader was president between 2002 and 2010.Paramilitary groupsUribe promoted legal paramilitary groups when he was governor of Antioquia.Uribe admitted to signing off on the creation of 69 paramilitary front companies called “CONVIVIR” as governor of Antioquia between 1995 and 1997.The former president stressed, however, that he was not responsible for their paramilitary activities as the national government was responsible for their oversight.Uribe admitted that “I said that they should have rifles,” but said this was “a mistake because of the despair of seeing so much violence.”I have always believed in the cooperation between citizens and the security forces. It wasn’t easy convincing the military and the public.Former President Alvaro UribeThe CONVIVIR became illegal in 1998 after their organized crime and terrorist activity triggered the Constitutional Court to ban the “cooperatives.”In response to a Medellin court order, the Supreme Court opened an investigation into Uribe’s alleged role in the 1997 formation of paramilitary organization AUC.The former president also falsely claimed that his government “32,000” AUC members, contradicting the court, which sentenced former Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo to prison for having inflated this numbers.Extrajudicial executionsUribe and a family member of the victims of the 2005 Cajamarca Massacre.The former president also denied any responsibility in the surge in extrajudicial executions by the military after Uribe took office in 2002.In relation to a execution of a family of five, including one baby, in the central Colombian town of Cajamarca, Uribe said that the massacre was an “error” committed during a military operation against the FARC’s 21st Front.According to the former president, he lied to the public because he was “deceived” by the soldiers who have since been convicted for the massacre.Uribe falsely claimed that “I have never granted financial benefits to members of the armed forces” that skyrocketed the mass killing of civilians by the security forces.The former president personally signed the so-called “Boima” decree in 2006 that granted a “Bonus for Operations of National Importance” to members of the security forces and intelligence agency DAS.Uribe only agreed to address talking points that had been agreed previously and refused to answer any questions.Truth Commissioner president Francisco de Roux announced his commission would verify the claims made Uribe as it is trying to clarify what happened during the armed conflict.

" Colombia’s prosecution has only achieved 41 convictions for the killing and disappearing of at least 299 former FARC guerrillas, according to the United Nations (UN).The convictions indicate how the Prosecutor General’s Office has failed to effectively investigate the killing and disappearing of former FARC guerrillas and other participants in the peace process.Anti-FARC violenceSince the FARC’s 2017 demobilization and disarmament, at least 278 reintegrating former guerrillas were assassinated, another 63 survived assassination attempts and 21 disappeared, according to the UN.Assassinations per provinceViolence against civiliansBetween 2017 and last year, the UN confirmed the assassination of 550 human rights defenders and community activists, of whom many were actively involved in the peace process.In the course of this year, the UN confirmed the assassinations of another six social leaders and is allegedly verifying another 80.Additionally, the international observers are allegedly verifying reports on 24 massacres that allegedly occurred in 2021.These deadly attacks against civilians are taking place in exactly the same regions as the assassinations of demobilizing FARC members, according to the UN and local human rights organizations.Violence against civilians escalated in May after which at least 80 anti-government protesters were assassinated by members of the National Police and extremist supporters of President Ivan Duque, according to local and international human rights organizations.Colombia’s anti-government protesters facing legal and death threatsColombia’s failing justice systemThe prosecution hasn’t revealed any updated statistics on the mass killing of social leaders since February and progress reports on the investigations of massacres at all.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa has also been reluctant to investigate the violence against people taking part in largely peaceful protests against Duque, one of the chief prosecutors’ best friends.In the case of the violence against demobilized FARC guerrillas, the Prosecutor General’s Office issued 279 arrest warrants for suspected participants in this often deadly violence since 2017, according to the UN.The criminal investigations have allegedly only resulted in 44 convictions however.Prosecution progressPeace process falling apartInitial security advances made as an apparent consequence of the peace process have been undone by an increase of deadly violence throughout Colombia after Duque took office in 2018.Instead of fighting illegal armed groups that are held responsible for the majority of the killings related to the peace process, the government has used its resources to violently crack down on legitimate opposition.Fighting between these illegal armed group doubled the number of victims of forced displacement to more than 29,000 over the past year, according to the UN.Contrary to evidence, the Duque administration has insisted that it is implementing the peace process and defeating the illegal armed groups that control much of Colombia’s countryside. armed conflictpeace processProsecutor General's OfficeUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-prosecution-bungles-investigations-into-peace-process-attacks/,Colombia’s prosecution bungles investigations into peace process attacks

" President Ivan Duque formally laid out his government’s priorities for Colombia on Saturday as the far-right president entered his final year in office.In an address to the military, Duque said that his priorities were finishing his National Vaccination Plan to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the reactivation of the economy, increased support for young people and the poor, and the “defense of legality.”For the first time since taking office, the president on multiple occasions referred to the implementation of peace policies and elements of a 2016 peace deal signed between demobilized FARC guerrillas and Duque’s predecessor.Priority #1: mass vaccinationThe president reiterated that his most urgent priority was the vaccination of more than 35 million Colombians, or 70% of the population, before the end of his term in August next year.Duque vowed to have done this before the end of this year, but has seen his government’s National Vaccination Plan bogged down by distribution issues.National Vaccination Plan progressMore economic reactivationIn order to have a government budget with which the president would be able to finance aid for the poor and young Colombians, the president said in July already he would seek a tax reform.Duque additionally would seek a reform the country’s royalty system that would leave more revenue made from oil and mining in Bogota, government-loyal newspaper El Tiempo reported last month.The president said he would seek to use the increased tax revenue for “a safe reactivation of the economy” that would prioritize the creation of jobs.Duque vowed policies that would empower small and medium-sized businesses that historically generate most employment, but were hit hardest by the economic consequences of the coronavirus.The government’s initial response to the pandemic sought to provide aid to the financial sector, which creates relatively few jobs.The president’s economic reactivation plans so far failed to create jobs for those who became unemployed during the crisis, data by statistics agency DANE indicates.Colombia’s unemployment rateAnti-poverty policiesDuque said that he would maintain the monthly $45 stipend for the poor and provide free higher education for high-school graduates.The president did not mention that he sunk plans to expand aid for the poor and that the free education proposal would not cover higher education until graduation.According to the opposition and leaders of anti-government protests that have been ongoing since late April consider the proposals insufficient and demand Congress to amend the bills so they would result in a meaningful fight against poverty, which skyrocketed as a consequence of the coronavirus.Colombia’s congress returns to government crisis and electoral ambitionsDuque’s “legality”Duque’s defense of “legality” includes a reform of the National Police, which is accused of committing crimes against humanity in its attempts to quell massive protests against the far-right government.The president did not mention any police reform, but said his defense of legality “implies the protection of peaceful protest without being considerate with vandalism, destruction [and] with low-intensity terrorism.”Duque has been claiming that violent incidents that occurred during the largely peaceful protests were part of a low-intensity terrorism campaign.Peaceful protest is defended and protected, but where there is vandalism and crime, the Colombian State will be there to protect the rights of all.President Ivan DuqueDefense Minister Diego Molano previously implied that this alleged terrorism campaign justified the use of military resources against the social organizations opposing the government.The security forces have come under scrutiny after human rights organizations reported the killing of at least 80 protesters, the disappearance hundreds of young people and the allegedly illegal detention of thousands of people.A final effort for peace?More than in any of his previous “Battle of Boyaca” speeches, the president committed to implement peace policies and specifically the peace deal between the FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos.In an indirect snide to his predecessor who won a Nobel Peace Prize, Duque said that that #peace is not in awards or applause or in the distinguished halls of international diplomacy. Peace is built in the territories.”Peace if the absence of crime and…  the absence of violence.President Ivan DuqueFor three years, the president has reluctantly implemented parts of the peace process while blatantly violating others.In his last year, however, Duque vowed to focus particularly on social development in war-torn regions that was designated as priority areas in the peace deal and in many cases have seen the a return of violence and armed conflict during the current administration. executive orderIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/duque-includes-peace-in-list-of-colombias-priorities-in-final-year/,Duque includes peace in list of Colombia’s priorities for final year

" Colombia’s defense minister on Wednesday blamed anti-government protesters for a surge in violent crime in the capital Bogota allegedly caused by illegal armed groups.Defense Minister Diego Molano and his deputy Juan Pablo Diaz were called to Congress to explain what they plans to do in response to the increased presence of illegal armed groups in Bogota reported by the Ombudsman’s Office.Diaz confirmed the Ombudsman’s warnings about the increase in “alleged activity of national organized crime groups such as” paramilitary group AGC, dissidents of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC, and regional crime organizations like “Los Paisas” and “Los Boyacos.”Molano confirmed that “the increase in homicides in Bogota this year is 14%, robbery 18%, [and] extortion 10%” compared to 2020.According to the defense ministry, homicides in the impoverished south of the city went up 49%.According to the Ombudsman’s Office, the deteriorating security situation is caused by violence between illegal armed groups who are expanding their territory in the capital.The risk scenario is caused by the expansion and dispute for control of the routes between the armed organized crime group Los Paisas and the armed organized crime group Los Bayacos, and the presence of non-state actors as part of the armed conflict, such as the ELN and dissident factions of the FARC-EP.Ombudsman’s OfficeMolano blatantly contradicted the Ombudsman’s report and his own deputy, and blamed anti-government protests that have been taking place near two bus terminals for the increase in organized crime.Areas that they have tried to turn into points of anarchy, such as the Americas terminal, have caused an increase in homicides and violence.Defense Minister Diego MolanoIn order to combat the deteriorating security situation, the defense minister said he was sending another 1,500 extra police officers to Bogota.Molano made a similar promise in February, but asked local authorities to cough up the funds.Colombia’s defense minister asks mayors for money to recruit policeAccording to the capital’s security secretary, the city’s police department, Bogota’s police department was reinforced with 570 rookie police officers after their graduation from the police academy.The increase in violence in the capital is relatively low compared to the rest of the country where homicides increased 24%, according to the defense ministry.

" The death of business mogul Carlos Ardila, one of Colombia’s most powerful oligarchs, was met with mixed emotions in the South American country.Ardila died on Friday at 91, leaving his estimated net worth of $2.3 billion and a gigantic business empire to his four children.A controversial legacyThe media and sugar magnate became one of Colombia’s most controversial entrepreneurs after getting a job in the soft drink company of his father-in-law, Gaseosas Lux, in the 1950s.By the end of the 1950’s, Ardila had helped Lux acquire the rights to sell Pepsi in Colombia and buy the company’s biggest rival, Postobon, of which he initially became CEO.Intervention in politicsThe businessman was elected senator for the Conservative Party in 1974, but resigned after only a few weeks as Ardila believed that “businessmen should intervene in politics through their businesses,” according to his friend, former Congressman Rafael Serrano.A year before his brief stint in politics, the businessman from Bucaramanga bought his first radio station, which would later become RCN, one of Colombia’s most influential media companies.In the remainder of the 20th century, Ardila expanded his wealth by buying up the companies that provided the sugar and bottles for Postobon.The president of sugar plantation owners’ association Asocaña, Claudia Calero, praised Ardila as a “great business leader, and an example of social commitment and development.”Asocaña and Ardila’s sugar company Incauca are among the main recipients of government benefits in Colombia.Totalitarianism in Colombia | Part 1: the coffee corporatistsPower over public opinionIn 1996, Ardila’s corporation saved Atletico Nacional after the 1993 death of drug lord and sports aficionado Pablo Escobar plunged the Medellin soccer club in crisis.The businessman grew his political power through expanding RCN, which acquired one on Colombia’s two commercial television networks in the 1990’s.By the turn of the century, Ardila’s influence over public opinion had made him one of the most powerful businessmen in Colombia.RCN was one of the driving forces behind the 2002 election of far-right President Alvaro Uribe while Postobon allegedly sponsored paramilitary organization AUC.The five families who own the news in ColombiaPolitics for profitUribe rewarded Ardila by leasing state-owned land in the southwestern Cauca province to Incauca, one of Ardila’s sugar companies, in 2005.This deal created major tensions between Ardila and indigenous people from Cauca, who had been promised this land in compensation for a paramilitary massacre.Former paramilitaries began revealing the extent of the alleged ties between Ardila’s corporations and the organization that was declared a foreign terrorist organization by the US Government in 2001.MINGA! | Part 1: Colombia’s indigenous vs the media mogulArdila’s news outlets have been among the fiercest critics of a 2016 deal between now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos.RCN and NTN24 have also been among the fiercest critics of protests against President Ivan Duque that have erupted since Colombia’s current government took office in 2018.Public approval of “the media” plunged this year after protests broke out against Duque’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, which devastated the economy but boosted Ardila’s net worth.

" Representatives of Colombia’s government and pharmaceutical firms held an emergency meeting on Wednesday after confidential COVID-19 vaccine contracts were leaked.According to local media, representatives of US company Pfizer and British company AstraZeneca met with government officials in the presidential palace in the capital Bogota.No announcement were made after the meeting over the leak by the Anticorruption Institute, which revealed that the government is paying Pfizer $12 per shot and Astrazeneca $6 per shot.The pharmaceutical firms included a confidentiality clause in contracts with governments around the world while selling the vaccines that could end the deadly effects of the pandemic.The leaking of the contractual  obligations, particularly the rice, severely weakens the pharmaceutical firms’ future negotiation position.A Spanish leak, for example, showed in April that the European Union paid Pfizer $18 per shot.According to the contract with Pfizer leaked in Colombia, the revelation of details of the contract allows the pharmaceutical company to seek compensation with the government.Other leaked elements from the Pfizer dealThe Colombian government agreed to pay for each Pfizer shipment 10 days before arrivalPfizer could suspend the agreed delivery of vaccines if the government failed to pay as agreedIn the event payments were made late, the government would have to pay interestPfizer could under no circumstance be sued in the event of unexpected side effectsConditions would chance if a court order forced the government to reveal the content of the contracts.The leak created a major problem for the government of the increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque whose National Vaccination Plan has been suffering all kinds of delays.Delays in the announced delivery of Pfizer vaccines, for example, could be the consequence of the government’s failure to meet its financial obligations.The consequences of the leak, and the renewed talks between the pharmaceutical companies and the government are unlikely to be revealed voluntarily.

In fact, Restrepo has been wading through 180 amendments requested by Congress.Newspaper El Tiempo reported last week that these hurdles would be our of the way this week, but the government-loyal news outlet may have been drinking the minister’s Kool-Aid.From optimism to concernBruce MacMaster (image: ANDI)The president of the powerful business federation ANDI, Bruce MacMaster, said Tuesday that “there seems to be no awareness about what this tax reform hopes to achieve,” which would be “social and fiscal stability.”The director of the Colombo-American Chamber of Commerce, Maria Claudia Lacouture, told newspaper El Nuevo Siglo that another priority is to “send a message of investment confidence to the international community and especially” the crediting rating agencies.Multiple US rating agencies downgraded Colombia’s credit rating over the past few months and still believe that the country “does not meet the requirements to maintain its investment grade,” think tank Colombia Risk Analysis Tweeted last week.Colombia presents new tax reform ahead of new protestsElectoral interestsOne of Retrepo’s problems is that neither foreign investors nor credit rating agencies are allowed to vote in next year’s congressional elections or contribute to campaigns.If lawmakers want to successfully lure voters into reelecting them in March next year, they need funding for their campaign, not funding for the government.Congressmen are under additional pressure over broad public disapproval over the economic policy, which fueled mass anti-government protests in 2019 and earlier this year.Colombia celebrates after Duque withdraws loathed tax reform plansBig business a tiny sectorThe Association of Small and Medium-sized Businesses (ACOPI) want Congress to approve progressive corporate taxes that would allow the reactivation of their sector.Unlike ANDI’s corporations or Lacauture’s foreign investors, small and medium-sized businesses have historically created the bulk of jobs in Colombia and have been hit the hardest by the pandemic.Economists have additionally criticized Restrepo’s tax reform, claiming it would further incentivize already rampant tax evasion.Duque’s second finance minister has until Christmas recess for its second attempt to push a tax reform through Congress, which so far doesn’t seem to go as well as planned.Coronavirus crisis bankrupted 500K of Colombia’s small businesses 2022 budgetandiJose Manuel Restrepotax reformtaxes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-2022-budget-uncertain-as-congress-bogs-down-tax-reform/,Colombia’s 2022 budget uncertain as Congress bogs down tax reform

" More than 15% of the inhabitants of a war-torn region in northern Colombia have allegedly been displaced over the past days because of an explosion of violence.According to the governor of the Antioquia province, Luis Fernando Suarez, more than 3,700 inhabitants have arrived in the urban center of Ituango after fleeing their homes in the rural part of the municipality.This is more than 10% of the approximately 25,000 inhabitants of the entire municipality, according to statistics agency DANE.Armed conflict reignitesThe mass displacement would be the consequence of renewed violence between rearmed guerrillas of the now-defunct rebel group FARC and paramilitaries of paramilitary group AGC.The rival groups have been vying for control over the municipality considered of major strategic importance for drug trafficking for years.The former FARC guerrillas rearmed after their 2017 demobilization and disarmament led up to a surge in paramilitary violence that targeted reintegrating FARC members in the municipality.Weather impedes emergency aidThe regional disaster response agency said Monday that they and the United Nations have packed a helicopter with aid that will be leaving for Ituango as soon as adverse weather conditions allow.The Antioquia Inspector General warned of impeding food shortages if relief is not able to reach the remote town shortly, according to newspaper El Tiempo.Interior Minister Daniel Palacios and commanders of the security forces would also visit the neglected region that has been left at the mercy of illegal armed groups on Tuesday.Defense Minister Diego Molano did not respond to the situation until Tuesday morning as he was at a summit to expose his conspiracy theory claiming that Colombia’s “latest threat” is “low-intensity urban terrorism” that would justify violently cracking down on peaceful anti-government protests.Visibly frustrated, Medellin council member Luis Bernardo Velez urged authorities in the provincial capital to prepare for the arrival of displaced people in the city.62% of the population of Medellin voted “no” to the plebiscite on peace in 2016. Today it must prepare to receive the families of Ituango, a municipality that with 68% supported peace and today is once again a victim of forced displacement.Medellin council member Luis Bernardo VelezThe capital has historically been one of  the most violent municipalities in Colombia during the country’s armed conflict.Following a peace deal between now-defunct guerrilla group FARC and President Juan Manuel Santos in 2016, the town became a priority region and was promised social investment to overcome the historical violence.Santos’ successor, President Ivan Duque, has refused to implement much of the peace deal that was agreed upon with the former guerrillas and victims, which has led to a resurgence of of armed conflict in Ituango and other historically violent regions.

" Colombia’s migration agency illegally detained and expelled a German citizen after media personalities embarked on a stigmatization campaign that got one person killed.Senator Maria Fernanda Cabal of President Ivan Duque’s Democratic Center party was among the most prominent politicians who took part in a stigmatization campaign against German citizen Rebecca Stroesser who was illegally expelled from Colombia on Wednesday.The story of Maria Fernanda Cabal, the Colombian senator who took on the New York TimesStroesser published pictures of anti-government protests she took part in with friends after they erupted in late April while she was on holiday in Cali, Colombia’s third largest city and caught the eye on the media, particularly notorious far-right personalities.Colombia’s anti-government protests | Part 1: fighting fascism with carnivalIgnorant celeb #1Luis Carlos VelezThe notoriously dishonest director of radio station La FM, Luis Carlos Velez, grilled Stroesser about her participation in the protests, denying her constitutional right to take part.The radio website of Velez’ website replicated baseless government propaganda that the so-called Frontline group that defended protesters against police brutality was funded by the ELN.La FM additionally falsely claimed that the temporary blocking of roads was against the law.Fact-checking Colombia’s media: La FM boss Luis Carlos VelezDeath threats beginFar-right activists immediately began according the tourist of being a “collaborator of the M-19,” a guerrilla group that demobilized in 1990 and threatened with death.We are locating her to give that German what she deserves.

The Colombian government is going to look for a way to make me pay pack that damage.”The assassination attemptWithin a week, Stroesser suffered an assassination attempt. The tourist survived because one of the friends she made in Cali jumped between her and the assassin.Cali Police denied the assassination attempt, claiming that the shooting was part of a botched robbery and that the German tourist’s unnamed friend was a criminal without providing any evidence.Colombia expels German protest supporter after assassination attemptFollowing the assassination attempt, Velez reiterated the unfounded claims made by the police on Saturday, claiming that he was the one who had received death threats and that the “rapid stigmatization of a group of politicians and their supporters in the media is very dangerous.”Migration officials arrested and expelled Stroesser on Wednesday, which was illegal, according to former Constitutional Court president Jose Gregorio Hernandez, and in violation of international law, according to the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, Jose Miguel Vivanco.‘Colombia illegally detained, expelled German protest supporter’Ignorant celeb #2Maria Andrea NietoFormer politician and Semana columnist Maria Andrea Nieto celebrated the allegedly illegal arrest and deportation with a sign saying “Goodbye Rebecca!” We do not need them to come here to promote violence and hatred, let them go to their own countries and see if they can put up with their progressive ‘revolutions’ made in Colombia.Maria Andrea NietoHero dies aloneStroesser learned that the friend who saved her life, Jhoan Sebastian Bonilla, had died after she arrived in Europe.Hours before, migration chief Juan Francisco Espinosa reiterated the unsubstantiated claim that the man who saved the German tourist’s death was a criminal.Because of the allegedly unconstitutional entry ban, Stroesser will not be able to attend the funeral of the Cali native who died to save her life.

" The congressional coalition of Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque has lost seven lawmakers since the 2018 elections because of criminal investigations.With the exception of two convicted lawmakers who were elected in 2018, the coalition parties have been able to replace their detained representatives because the lawmakers resigned and continue to be on trial.In total, 17 coalition congressmen have been formally accused of criminal activity since Colombia’s most recent elections.The drug trafficking problem of Colombia’s CongressSupreme Court convictionsThe Conservative Party lost Senator-elect Aida Merlano’s seat in 2018 already because the politician was arrested before she could take office and has since been convicted for election fraud.The U Party lost the seat of former Senator Eduardo Pulgar last month after the Supreme Court convicted the politician on corruption charges.Convicted lawmakersAll other coalition parties have been able to avoid losing seats because their lawmakers resigned after their arrest and are still being investigated.Only in the event of a conviction, political parties would have to abandon the seat of their criminal members.Coalition investigationsSupreme Court investigationsThree former lawmakers were unable to evade a Supreme Court investigation because they allegedly abused their political position to commit crimes.Only former Conservative Party representative Jimmy Harold is in jail, however.The Prosecutor General’s Office lifted the house arrest of former President Alvaro Uribe after the controversial politician resigned from the Senate in August last year and the Supreme Court forwarded the fraud and bribery investigation against Duque’s boss to the notoriously corrupt prosecution.Former House Representative Alvaro Hernan Prada resigned in April this year, but to no avail as the top court ruled that the far-right politician had abused his position as lawmaker to commit crimes.For the same reason, the Supreme Court has continues investigating Uribe’s alleged conspiracy with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 elections in the favor of the president.Resigned since 2018 electionsDoing the UribeUribe’s resignation started a trend among allegedly criminal lawmakers who hoped to have more luck with the prosecution by resigning from the senate, but with mixed success.The former president was able to have two investigations transferred to the prosecution, which lifted the house arrested imposed by the Supreme Court and allowed his far-right Democratic Center party to replace its leader in Congress.The court continued to investigate Uribe’s alleged conspiracy with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 presidential election in favor of Duque, however.The court also continued to investigate former House Representative Alvaro Hernan Prada after Uribe’s alleged accomplice in a witness tampering conspiracy resigned in April.Former Senator Richard Aguilar (Radical Change) and House Representative Jose Caicedo (U Party) resigned last month after they were arrested on corruption charges.The Supreme Court has yet to decide whether or not to forward Aguilar’s investigation to the prosecution, but ruled last week that it would forward Caicedo’s investigation to the prosecution.Jailed former lawmakersThe quiet investigationsThe Supreme Court has yet to announce what to do with Senate President Juan Diego Gomez (Conservative Party) who has been accused of all kinds of crimes.Gomez’s predecessor, Senator Arturo Char (Radical Change), was able to end his year as president of the Senate despite being investigated for his alleged role in the fraudulent election of Merlano and the convicted politician’s jail break in 2019.To add insult to injury, Senator Laureano Acuña was elected the head of the Senate’s Ethics Committee last month despite the Conservative Party lawmaker’s alleged complicity in Merlano election fraud.House Representative Edward Rodriguez (Democratic Center) said last month that the court opened a preliminary investigation into the far-right politician’s role in attempts to bribe the Supreme Court.Another member of the president’s party, House Representative Edwin Ballesteros, has been called to testify before the Supreme Court later this month for the corruption in Santander that led to the arrest of Aguilar.Investigated lawmakersThe prosecution in 2018 announced election fraud investigations into Democratic Center Senators Maria Fernanda Cabal and Margarita Restrepo, Radical Change Senator Fabian Castillo, Liberal Party Senator Julian Bedoya and U Party Representative Faber Muñoz.The status of these investigations is entirely unclear. corruptionlegislative order ",https://colombiareports.com/the-mounting-criminal-investigations-against-colombias-government-coalition/,The mounting criminal investigations against Colombia’s government coalition
" Colombia´s migration authority violated the rights of a German citizen by detaining and expelling her after she openly supported ant-government protests, according to a former Constitutional Court president.Following public indignation about the expulsion and 10-year entry ban imposed on German tourist Rebecca Sproesser, migration chief Juan Francisco Espinosa said the decision “counts on all the judicial support.”This is false, according to former magistrate Jose Gregorio Hernandez, who told foreign journalists that Espinosa’s office violated Sproesser’s constitutional rights.It isn’t right or legal she has been expelled. In Colombia, according to article 100 of the Constitution, foreigners have the same civil rights as Colombians. Article 100 explicitly points out foreigners are granted exactly the same civil rights as Colombians. Only the law may deny some some rights to foreigners for the sake of public order, but only civil rights, not fundamental rights. The constitution also says that foreigners enjoy the same guarantees as citizens.Former Constitutional Court president Jose Gregorio HernandezThe Americas director of Human Rights Watch, Jose Miguel Vivianco, additionally said that the migratory norm used to expel the German from Colombia “contradicts international standards because it allows the expulsion of a foreigner who is legally in the country without guaranteeing the right to have his or her case reviewed by a competent authority.Sproesser was arrested on Tuesday after filing a report with the prosecution in Cali over an assassination attempt that followed a far-right stigmatization campaign last week.The German tourist was expelled from Colombia on the same day without an opportunity to appeal the decision taken by Migration.Colombia expels German protest supporter after assassination attemptAt the request of Colombia Reports, lawyer’s collective Primera Linea Juridica vowed to look into the alleged rights violations of Migration and evidence of criminal activity of migration officials.The allegedly illegal expulsion of Sproesser comes weeks after this website exposed that Espinosa was facing contempt charges because of evidence of alleged fraud by top migration officials in the case of an American citizen.ICE embroiled in major fraud scandal in Colombia Germanymigrationnational strikenewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-illegally-detained-expelled-german-protest-supporter/,"‘Colombia illegally detained, expelled German protest supporter’"
" Colombia’s prosecution fiercely criticized the press for releasing evidence of the alleged fraud and bribery practices of former President Alvaro Uribe on Monday.Controversial prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes began exposing his arguments to file away a criminal investigation against Uribe, who resigned from the Senate to evade a Supreme Court detention order last year.Colombia’s prosecution misinforms court over Uribe’s alleged death squadAccording to the Supreme Court, evidence indicates that the former president used bribery to manipulate witnesses and file fraudulent charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda.Uribe’s early retirement from politics forced the high court to forward the criminal case to a lower court after which Jaimes began all kinds of efforts to absolve Uribe.Attempts to file the investigation away without court approval failed and Jaimes was forced to convince a judge despite Supreme Court evidence indicating the former president’s witness tampering practices.The prosecutor began stressing that allowing Uribe to get away with crimes was in “the common good of society.”The Prosecutor’s Office does not act for the applause of the gallery, nor does it condescend to particular interests. It simply and plainly fulfills its legal duties in order to promote values and principles that enrich the common good of society.Prosecutor Gabriel JaimesThe former president allegedly tried to manipulate witnesses who had testified that the Uribe family helped found one of Colombia’s most bloodthirsty death squads in the 1990’s.Multiple witnesses against Uribe and his political allies from the Antioquia province have been assassinated.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa is a loyal supporter of the political patron of President Ivan Duque, one of the chief prosecutor’s best friends.Colombia’s prosecution asks court to drop Uribe investigation despite evidenceBarbosa initially appointed Jaimes as a delegate before the Supreme Court and subsequently as the lead prosecutor in the Uribe case.The Supreme Court continues to investigate the former president’s alleged conspiracy with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 elections in the favor of his protégé.If the Bogota judge agrees to drop the investigation against Uribe, the former president’s alleged victims my appeal.

" More than 120,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Colombia, the Health Ministry said Thursday amid persistent problems to vaccinate the country’s population.So far, regional health authorities have fully vaccinated more than 11.7 million people of Colombia’s population of 51 million.President Ivan Duque and Health Minister Fernando Ruiz vowed to vaccinate almost 36 million people, the equivalent of 70% of the population, before the end of the year.The government may fail to meet this target, however, as vaccine distribution problems persist and some citizens continue to be reluctant to report for vaccination.According to the Health Ministry, which has lowered the vaccination age to 25, some 10 million people have yet to receive their first shot as part of the National Vaccination Plan.The combination of these factors could be the cause of the drop in daily vaccine shots administered in hospitals throughout the country.National Vaccination Plan rolloutLight at the end of the tunnel?Despite the recent slowdown, progress in the vaccination of people older than 30 has dramatically lowered the number of infections and deaths since the pandemic’s deadliest peak in late January.On Thursday, the Health Ministry reported 9,690 new cases and 325 new deaths, considerably less than the 685 deaths and almost 33,000 infections reported on January 25.The daily number of infections continue to be higher than during the first peak in August last year, but the daily number of deaths are lower.Coronavirus deaths and infectionsHospitals apparently recoveringThe lower fatality rate may have to do with the dramatic increase in capacity of intensive care units (ICU’s) in many parts of Colombia since the beginning of the capacity.This has allowed local and regional healthcare systems to slowly recover from collapses during the latest peaks.The ICU availability in the capital Bogota finally climbed to 29%, ending the red alert that had been in place since April.The hospital system in Medellin, Colombia’s second largest city, continued to be on red alert, but has seen the availability of its iCU’s drop to below 80% after a virtual complete saturation for months.The situation continues to be critical in the southwest of the country and the regional capital, Cali. coronavirusNational Vaccination Plannewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-exceeds-120000-covid-19-deaths-vaccination-woes-persist/,"Colombia exceeds 120,000 COVID-19 deaths, vaccination woes persist"

" Social organizations called new strikes for Tuesday, Colombia’s Independence Day, to demand that Congress passes legislation on economic policy, peace and human rights.The latest strike was called by the National Strike Committee more than 80 days after it’s initial April 28 strike sparked protests throughout Colombia that have continued in the cities.The initial protests successfully sunk a controversial tax reform, but failed to force the far-right government of President Ivan Duque to negotiate demands on economic policies in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The National Strike Committee has given up on the increasingly tyrannical government and is now trying to pressure Congress, which begins a new legislative year on Tuesday,Duque isolated as many in Colombia go on strike againMany lawmakers would like to be reelected in March next year and wouldn’t want to see their public approval tank like that of Duque who became Colombia’s least popular president in history.The strike leaders wants Congress to pass legislation that would grant a temporary minimum basic income to curb poverty that has skyrocketed during the pandemic.The National Strike Committee also wants Congress to force the government to implement a 2016 peace deal and recommendations issued by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on how to comply to international human rights standards.Peace deal offers solutions to Colombia´s crisis: UNThe strike leaders have a list of 10 demands that include less fundamental policy changes like a suspension of new policies that could affect people’s pensions.The National Strike Committee isn’t the only organization that announced mobilizations for Tuesday.The Organization of Colombia’s Indigenous Peoples (ONIC) also called for renewed protests to demand government compliance with previously made agreements on autonomy and peace building.Young Colombians who have joined so-called Frontline groups to protect other protesters from the police also announced new protests to demand an end to police brutality that killed at least 25 protesters during the protests.These Frontline groups are not associated with the National Strike Committee, but surged as young people were fed up with the historical oppression of youth.Colombia insists anti-government protests are national security threatThese young people have refused to call off protests and have set up permanent “resistance” camps near universities in Colombia’s largest cities.Feminist organizations are also expected to join the protests to reiterate their call to an end to sexual violence, specifically by the police.Defense Minister Diego Molano and the chief of police, General Jorge Luis Vargas, have actively tried to dissuade participation in the protests, claiming they would be infiltrated by ELN guerrillas.Mass media loyal to the government have replicated these unfounded claims while not informing on the different organizations’ motives to take to the streets. national strike ",https://colombiareports.com/why-many-in-colombia-embark-on-new-strike/,Why many in Colombia embark on new strike

" The “new threat” to Colombia’s national security is “low-intensity urban terrorism,” the country’s defense minister insisted on Monday.Defense Minister Diego Molano and far-right President Ivan Duque contradicted each other about the alleged new threat, but that didn’t seem to matter at the “International Seminar on Analysis and Prevention of Urban Terrorism” in Bogota.Duque’s terrorism conspiracy theoryDuque apparently wants the support of US ambassador Philip Goldberg to continue the “War on Terror” that was declared in 2011 in response to the 9/11 attacks.When it comes to terrorism, everybody in the world is threatened.President Ivan DuqueThe president specifically sought US support for sanctions against Venezuela, claiming that the dissident 33rd Front of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC “is protected in Venezuelan territory” as well as “Ivan Marquez.”Duque also claimed that “Pablito” and “Antonio Garcia” of Colombia’s last-standing guerrilla group ELN were not in Cuba as previously announced, but also in the neighboring countryThe president additionally sought support for his hardline counternarcotics policy that failed to prevent record cocaine production levels in 2020.Molano’s terrorism conspiracy theoryMolano mainly sought to criminalize dissent, claiming that any type of vandalism or violence was in fact “low-intensity urban terrorism” that justified the brutal cracking down of largely peaceful anti-government protests that started in April.This type of actions seeks to destabilize democracies, destabilize economies and institutions, and that is why we do not and will not allow it.Defense Minister Diego MolanoThe defense minister urged the importance to strengthen the country’s intelligence agencies to combat this “new threat,” which would imply spying on social organizations.National Security Adviser Rafael Guarin stressed that “the prevention of and fight against terrorism must be focused on the protection of human rights.”Human rightsThe US ambassador only expressed obligatory diplomatic niceties after the mass violation of human rights by the security forces increased tensions between Bogota and Washington DC.While Duque and his security officials sought support to step up tyranny, US Congress may cut security funds if Colombian authorities fail to investigate and punish the mass killing of anti-government protesters.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque will have to clarify his ties to a dodgy businessman who allegedly recruited veterans who ended up accused of assassinating Haiti’s president.State propaganda chief Hassan Nassar insisted that Duque “had no meeting with or ties to” Antonio Intriago despite evidence indicating the opposite.The then-presidential candidate, Ivan Duque, didn’t have any meeting with or any ties whatsoever to Mr. Antonio Intriago,State propaganda chief Hassan NassarAccording to Colombian and Haitian police, Intriago’s security company CTU recruited the Colombians who ended up being suspected of assassinating President Jovenel Moise.The non-existent photo of the meeting that never took placeHassan Nassar (Image: RCN Radio)News website La Nueva Prensa alerted Nassar on Sunday already that Duque met with Intriago when the then-candidate was campaigning in Florida on February 10, 2018 in an open information request.The propaganda chief responded that “there exists no registry of the photographic material” of the campaign meeting where the two allegedly never met.The news website published the photo of Duque and the owner of CTU after which The Miami Herald confirmed its veracity.The New York Times additionally said that the suspected key suspect in Moise’s assassination wasn’t just friendly with Colombia’s president, but also had a “history of debt, evictions and bankruptcies” in Florida.Duque’s murky foreign policy contactsLa Nueva Prensa additionally reported that Intriago and Duque met for a second time in February 2019 at “Venezuela Live Aid,” a concert in support of the opposition against Venezuelan tyrant Nicolas Maduro organized by the Colombian government and businessmen from the two neighboring countries.The concert turned out to be a PR disaster after images emerged of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido posing with members of drug trafficking organization “Los Rastrojos.”Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido poses with drug traffickers “Brother” and “El Menor.”Both Nassar and Guaido claimed the politicians posed with all kinds of people and were unaware that they were also posing with alleged criminals.Duque made a similar claim after photos revealed the president’s ties to a late money launderer until wiretaps triggered criminal investigations into the president’s party and his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.President Ivan Duque and late money launderer Jose Guillermo Hernandez.

" Colombia’s Congress will return from summer recess on Tuesday amid one of the worst government crises of the century and less than a year before elections.The increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque and media loyal to the government try to appear confident that his coalition will hold until after the elections in March next year.This is anything but certain though, especially because of the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic.According to newspaper El Tiempo, the president has the support of the coalition to push his priority bill, a tax reform, through Congress.Historically, the only way to get a budget finance bill through Congress in an election year is by securing enough slush funds with which lawmakers can finance their reelection campaign.Duque may have been able to please Congress, but is facing unprecedented opposition by labor unions, ethnic minorities and youth organizations that demand an economic recovery plan.These groups have organized renewed protests for Tuesday after successfully sinking the president’s initial tax reform proposal in May.If Congress is able to rush the approval of the tax reform, chances are this would increase social unrest and negatively affect lawmakers’ chances in March next year.As if approving a tax reform in an election year wasn’t tricky enough, the government also wants Congress to approve a police reform and an “anti-vandalism” bill that can also count on broad disapproval.Duque reportedly also plans to reform the country’s royalty system that would leave more revenue made from oil and mining in Bogota, but reduce revenue for municipalities affected by these industries.Apart from these legislative hurdles, the Supreme Court could rule any time on the government’s brutal repression of protests and the election fraud allegedly committed by the president’s far-right party.Duque’s attempts to violently repress protests and prevent the prosecution of his allies have destroyed colombia’s reputation abroad and put the country on the brink of a constitutional crisis.After the beginning of the election campaign in September, Duque’s coalition partners in Congress will likely reconsider their support for the government and focus on luring voters.If only one coalition party bails, Duque would become a lame duck president at best.

" Colombia’s finance minister presented a new tax reform proposal on Tuesday, just days ahead of a national strike that sunk the government’s initial proposal.The proposal of Finance Minister Jose Manuel Restrepo seeks considerably less tax revenue than the proposal of former Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla in May.Instead of trying to increase next year’s tax revenue with $6.5 billion (COP25 trillion), Restrepo said he sought an increase of $3.9 trillion (COP15 trillion).Compromises after mass protestsIn an apparent attempt to prevent a backlash like the one that cost the head of Restrepo´s predecessor, the new tax reform bill avoided any tax hikes for the middle class and on consumer products.Possibly as important, the finance minister proposed to reduce and delay corporate tax discounts that tanked the approval rating of President Ivan Duque in 2018 and 2019.Restrepo also vowed to step up efforts to combat rampant tax evasion, which historically has made financing government budgets incredibly difficult.The finance minister maintained plans to cut public spending and reduced the budget to combat poverty, which has increased as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.Instead of providing a monthly stipend of $45 (COP160,000) to 4.7 million poor households, only 3.5 million households would have access to the so-called Solidary Income program.This program, which grants households half of the extreme poverty rate, came to live shortly after duque all but shut down the economy in March last year to prevent the coronavirus to cause mass deaths.The government plans to maintain incentives that would facilitate higher education for young Colombians who have been at the forefront of the anti-government protests.An uphill battleThe mass protests kicked off on April 28 when social organizations called for a national strike largely in opposition to the previous tax reform bill.The tax bill will be formally presented to Congress on Tuesday next week, which is Colombia’s Independence Day and the first day of the new legislative year.The National Strike Committee, which organized the April 28 strike, announced earlier this month that it will organize another strike day on the day the new tax reform goes to Congress.Restrepo has said that he hopes to obtain congressional approval before the end of August as the government is in a rush.Congress’s deadline to approve the 2022 budget is set before the end of the year while the campaign for next year’s congressional elections will kick off in September.Pushing a tax reform in an election yearPushing a tax reform bill through Congress while lawmakers are trying to lure voters would be difficult in any election year.This is further complicated by the fact that Duque is so unpopular that election candidates might want to steer clear of any of the president’s proposals.Restrepo’s only option is to convince Congress before its members go on campaign because Duque has categorically refused to negotiate with protesters.If the finance minister fails, Colombia’s government will have no budget to deal with the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, or anything for that matter. 2022 budgetJose Manuel Restreponational strikenewslettertax reformtaxes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-presents-new-tax-reform-ahead-of-new-protests/,Colombia presents new tax reform ahead of new protests
" Colombia’s former ambassador to Chile admitted before the war crimes tribunal he ransacked his native province and terrorized locals to advance his political career.Former Ambassador Salvador Arana sent a shockwave through Sucre after exposing the alleged terrorist activity of more than two dozen businessmen, politicians and police officials from the Caribbean province.According to Arana, his private death squad threatened to kill locals in 1999 if they didn’t cooperate in one of his rackets to ransack the regional healthcare system.The locals initially were forced to sign up for healthcare insurance with a befriended company and subsequently claim they had undergone treatment at the hospital run by another friend.The racket allowed Arana to finance his death squad, which forced locals to vote for the warlord in the 2000 elections that made him governor in 2001.While in office, the warlord-turned-governor continued using the regional healthcare system for his personal benefit.During his first period in office, the regional police chief and the regional inspector general were members of his mafia.After having left office  in 2004, Arana and his mafia associates set their eyes on the public university and were able to put several members of paramilitary organization AUC in top positions in the university.This allowed the paramilitaries to embezzle education funds and recruit students while former President Alvaro Uribe was supposedly demobilized the designated terrorist organization.By then, Arana and the former president were already in trouble over the assassination of the mayor of El Roble in April 2003.In February 2003, El Roble mayor Edualdo Leon Diaz told Uribe on live television that he feared for his life after filing criminal charges against Arana.Two months later, Diaz was dead as the former governor ordered his death squad to torture and kill his critic.Look at what they invented and that they planned to kill me. The next step is, I repeat, that they are going to kill me.Late Mayor Eudaldo Leon DiazArana was appointed ambassador to Chile by Uribe in 2004, but was forced to resign in 2005 after Senator Gustavo Petro revealed the ambassador’s criminal and terrorist activity.The warlord-turned-diplomat was arrested in 2008 and convicted to 40 years in prison by the Supreme Court in 2009.Following the 2016 peace deal with the FARC, Arana requested to submit to the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), but was almost expelled in March after calling victims of his death squads “guerrilla associates.”After the warlord-turned-politician confessed and exposed his criminal associated, the JEP agreed to assume jurisdiction over Arana’s case, sending his alleged criminal  associates in a panic.

" A dramatic acceleration of vaccinations against COVID-19 is providing a light at the end of the tunnel of the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic in Colombia.Health Ministry statistics that were released on Sunday indicated a steady decline in COVID-19 infections during the third and most fatal peak since the beginning of the pandemic.The pressure on Colombia’s hospitals continues to be critical in most of the country’s big cities, but has decreased significantly over the past two weeks.This has in turn allowed hospitals to provide better care, which may have contributed to a reduced number of daily coronavirus deaths that reached almost 700 in late June.Coronavirus infections and deathsColombia’s mass vaccination drive picks up speedThe decreased pressure on the country’s hospital system coincides with a dramatic acceleration of the government’s National Vaccination Plan that kicked off on February 17.This unprecedented vaccination drive seeks to have vaccinated almost 36 million people, the equivalent of 70% of Colombia’s 51 million inhabitants, before the end of the year.Since the beginning of the National Vaccination Plan, almost 10 million of Colombia’s 51 million inhabitants have been vaccinated, the Health Ministry said Sunday.National Vaccination Plan rolloutLight at the end of the tunnelThe reported drop in infections and acceleration in vaccinations imply that the latest peak in deaths may be the last of the pandemic that has cost more than 112,000 lives in Colombia since February last year.According to healthcare organizations, this relatively high number of fatalities is largely due to the government’s rush to reactivate the economy after a temporary shutdown in April last year.President Ivan Duque’s controversial response to the pandemic tanked his approval rating and fueled major anti-government protests since April.While the social unrest is expected to last until after next year’s elections, the mass vaccination drive is providing a light at the end of the tunnel of the economic and health crisis caused by the pandemic. coronavirusNational Vaccination Plannewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-of-colombias-covid-crisis/,Light at the end of Colombia’s COVID-19 tunnel
" Colombia’s 2016 peace deal contains the necessary elements to resolve its current social crisis, the United Nations´ mission chief told the Security Council on Tuesday.During the presentation of his quarterly report on the progress of the peace process, UN mission chief Carlos Ruiz stressed the importance of the political participation chapter of the agreement.This chapter did not just seek the introduction of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC to Congress, but provide general guarantees for political opposition and peaceful protest in general.Instead of trying to negotiate an end to anti-government protests that erupted after a national strike on April 28, police tried to quell them with extreme violence that killed at least 53 people.The peace process demonstrated the value of dialogue in resolving the conflict, while the accord offered a set of instruments to resolve a number of long-pending issues, many of which have also been the subject of discussion in the context of the national strike.UN Colombia chief Carlos RuizThe increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque has refused to negotiate with protest leaders and has been reluctant to implement the peace deal since taking office in August 2018.“The implementation of these provisions” to curb political and social exclusion, however, “would be useful in the current context and for the future,” Ruiz told the members of the Security Council in New York City.The parties to the peace process recognized that peace building requires the active commitment of all Colombians and specified safeguards for political and citizen participation.UN Colombia chief Carlos RuizThe organizers of the April 28 strike announced a new strike day for July 20, Colombia’s Independence Day, to protest the far-right government’s plan to introduce a second draft of a tax reform to Congress.Duque withdrew his first draft in May in an attempt to appease protesters, but has refused to negotiate with social  organizations while preparing the far-right government’s second draft.The announcement another tax reform would be presented before Congress on July 20, which is also the beginning of the legislative year, triggered the April 28 strike organizers to call for renewed protests.The security forces will be subjected to extraordinary international scrutiny during the upcoming protests due to the widespread human rights violations committed in response to the previous protests. national strikenewsletterpeace processpolice brutalityUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/peace-deal-offers-solutions-to-colombias-crisis-un/,Peace deal offers solutions to Colombia´s crisis: UN

Next year, a new president and a new congress will be elected, and 2023 will see local and regional elections.United Nations secretary General Antonio Guterres referred to next year’s elections in a call to maintain the peace after at least 53 people were killed since anti-government protests kicked off on April 28.In these difficult times and as the country prepares for a new electoral cycle, I call upon all political and social actors in Colombia to commit to non-violence and to prioritize dialogue to find mutually agreeable solutions.United Nations Secretary General Antonio GuterresThe formal beginning of election campaigns in September is a reason for concern for some as President Ivan Duque’s far-right party, which has incited violence on multiple occasions, is expected to suffer a defeat.Additionally, the government’s security policy appears to have fallen apart under the weight of the crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic and record cocaine exports. armed conflicthuman rightsmassacresnewsletterpublic security ",https://colombiareports.com/steep-increase-in-massacres-in-colombia/,Steep increase in massacres in Colombia
" The government of Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque clashed with Congress over recommendations of the Organization of American States (OAS) on how to comply with human rights standards.The OAS’ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) released a scathing report over the security forces’ response to anti-government protests that left dozens dead since April 28.In the report, the IACHR made 41 recommendations on reforms and actions that would allow the government and the security forces to comply with international human rights law.Colombia clashes with OAS over damning human rights reportGovernment believes human rights are optionalThe OAS’  human rights commission additionally announced the formation of a special commission to monitor the government’s follow-up to the report and its recommendations.In a response, Duque and Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez said that adhering to these recommendations wasn’t compulsory.The government may indeed ignore specific IACHR recommendations, but could be found guilty of blatantly violating international human rights law.The IACHR has the authority to prosecute OAS member states before the Inter-American Court for Human Rights.Members of the president’s far-right Democratic Center party accused the OAS commission of bias and proposed to withdraw from the inter-American human rights system.This proposal was rejected by State Defense attorney Camilo Gomez.Recovering lost reputationCongress’ peace commission asked the government on Thursday to reconsider its refusal to adhere to the OAS commission’s recommendations, claiming this would allow Duque to “recover the confidence and legitimacy on the international stage.”Until last week, only the tyrannical regimes of Venezuela and Nicaragua were subject to a Special Monitoring Mechanism for Human Rights Issues of the IACHR.Colombia’s far-right regime put on despot watch listThe OAS commission’s president, Antonia Urrejola, told newspaper El Espectador on Friday that “the committee is confident that the differences can be overcome” as its monitoring mechanism is taking effect.Duque has come under increased international criticism and scrutiny over his reluctance to implement a 2016 peace deal with the FARC, dictatorial tendencies and violations of human rights.Ahead of the IACHR, the United Nations, US Congress and the European Parliament had already expressed their concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Colombia.Domestically, the far-right government has lost public support due to its response to the coronavirus pandemic and piling evidence of ties with organized crime.Duque has tried to expand his control over next year’s elections that could result in a crushing defeat for the president’s political allies.At the same time, the government coalition controversially approved and allegedly illegal new law that would allow the Inspector General to persecute political opposition.The Supreme Court condemned the government in September last year for the violent repression of anti-government protests in 2019, but has yet to respond to the gross human rights violations registered this year. human rightsIACHROAS ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-government-cornered-over-human-rights-violations/,Colombia’s government at odds with Congress over human rights sanction
" Without a shred of evidence, Colombia´s controversial defense minister on Wednesday claimed that illegal armed groups are behind anti-government protests called for July 20.Following a meeting in Cali, Defense Minister Diego Molano recycled the conspiracy theory that guerrillas would be involved in protests announced by social organizations.Some intelligence indicates that FARC dissidents and the ELN continue with the intention of financing violent actions, so all Police and Army devices will continue in Cali to guarantee free movement and avoid blockades.Defense Minister Diego MolanoMolano coined the same conspiracy during previous protests that started on April 28 after which armed civilians and the security forces subjected Colombia’s third largest city to multiple terror campaigns.We will not allow what happened on April 28 to happen again.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque appears to have given up on combating drug trafficking 50 years after the beginning of the disastrous War on Drugs.For the first time since taking office, Duque didn’t even mention drug trafficking after talking to his American counterpart Joe Biden last week.Biden’s press secretary said the US president had called for a “holistic” counternarcotics approach in their first phone call, but the Colombian president had other things in mind.Prosecutors were interrogating the husband of Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez over his role in drug money laundering by the capital’s real estate tycoons.The Supreme Court was already investigating Duque’s political patron, former President and admitted former Medellin Cartel associate Alvaro Uribe since last year.Evidence indicated Uribe conspired with the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa whose late money launderer helped finance Duque’s 2018 presidential campaign.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersAll talk, no actionDefense Minister Diego Molano, who swore that in March he would kick off the aerial fumigation of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, in March, appears to have forgotten the controversial strategy that was announced at least seven times.Some 40 lawmakers requested the Constitutional Court to verify the government’s compliance with conditions that would allow the resumption of the controversial strategy in early June, but have yet to receive a response.The delays and false promises make it increasingly unlikely the Duque administration will be able to resume spraying before leaving office in August next year.Statistics lose meaningDefense Ministry statistics indicate that the manual eradication of coca increased with more than 30% between January and May compared to the same period last year, but these statistics have lost all meaning.Coca cultivation went up by 33,000 hectares to 245,000 in 2020, according to the US Government, raising questions about Bogota’s claims that more than 130,000 hectares were eradicated last year.The White House last week confirmed claims by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime that Colombia produced more cocaine that ever last year.The disintegration of Duque’s counternarcotics coincides with the 50th anniversary of  the War on Drugs, which is widely considered an epic failure, except by the narcos. counternarcoticsdrug traffickingwar on drugs ",https://colombiareports.com/after-50-years-colombia-seems-to-have-given-up-on-drug-war/,"After 50 years, Colombia seems to have given up on drug war"
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque appears to have given up on trying to recover from the worst economic crash in recorded history.Duque couldn’t stop talking about economic recovery in the aftermath of the crash that followed a virtual shutdown of the economy in April last year.Actually, recovering economic activity is a lot more complicated, however, this would require the execution of an actual strategy, which may be a bridge too far for Colombia’s president.Economic think tanks have been making one proposal after another to overcome the crisis, but can’t seem to get through to the government that apparently fails to comprehend the most basic of economic theory.Think tanks Fedesarollo and ANIF on Wednesday reiterated the need for public policies that stimulate domestic consumption while the export sector recovers.Fedesarollo stressed for the umpteenth time that an increase in spending on the poor would not just diminish widespread hunger and insecurity, but create jobs in the food industry and raise tax revenue.ANIF stressed the importance of creating jobs for people under 28 who are historically suffering high unemployment rates.According to statistics agency DANE, youth unemployment in the first quarter of the year was 23.9% compared to 21.6% in the last three months of 2020.General unemployment continued to go up as it has since Duque took office and ended at 15.6% in May.DANE’s monthly statistics seem to indicate that unemployment has only accelerated during the president’s economic reactivation.Monthly unemployment rateThis could be because Duque has ignored economists and continues to push the same “Orange Economy” plans that failed to create jobs before the coronavirus pandemic.While Colombia’s youth was massively protesting against the president’s economic policy, Duque met up with a few dozen students to introduce his “Colombia Youth Pact.”On Thursday, the president specified that this pact meant a one-time $42 million investment in technical education that would prepare young people for the “Fourth Revolution” and his “Orange Economy”.Additionally, $17.8 million will be invested for training programs in multimedia production, video game development, 3D animation, photography and digital processes, among others.La RepublicaDuque couldn’t be more detached from the economist of Fedesarollo and ANIF who urged for an annual investment of more than $600 million in order to finance an emergency employment plan.This plan would immediately put money in the pockets of young people, and increase both consumption and productivity while reducing poverty, according to the economists, who weren’t particularly concerned about video games.Deputy Vice-Minister Jesus Bejarano wasn’t too enthusiastic about the economists’  plan and urged not to “only dedicate ourselves to reducing monetary and extreme poverty while neglecting the fiscal part”.Speaking of which, Bejarano had barely finished his sentence about Fitch downgrading Colombia’s long-term foreign-currency rating to “junk,” but added that it also revised its outlook from negative to stable. economic reactivationIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-government-apparently-abandons-basic-economics/,Colombia’s government apparently abandons basic economics
" A Bogota judge on Saturday jailed a self-proclaimed elite entrepreneur who has allegedly been trafficking drugs and laundering money since the days of the Medellin Cartel.Guillermo León Acevedo, a.k.a. “Memo Fantasma,” is arguably one of Colombia’s most elusive and well-connected underworld figures of the past decades.According to crime website InSight Crime, the self-proclaimed real-estate tycoon started off with late drug lord Pablo Escobar in the 1980s and was one of the main money men of paramilitary group Central Bolivar Bloc.Following the 2005 demobilization of the BCB, Memo became all but a ghost until 2020 when InSight Crime tracked the “businessman” down in Madrid and revealed he was in business with the husband of Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez.Colombia’s vice-president tied to senior narco: reportThe VP was disgraced even more when website La Nueva Prensa revealed Martinez’s brother is a convicted former heroin trafficker.President Ivan Duque had proven ties to a drug trafficker organization as well as the president’s political patron,  former  President Alvaro Uribe, who grew up with the founding Medellin Cartel bosses of the Ochoa crime family.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersThe government has been trying to downplay their ties to the mafia, but with little success, especially after evidence emerged of drug traffickers sponsoring Duque’s 2018 election early last year.Memo was arrested in Bogota late last month, which reportedly sent a shockwave through the business elite in the capital  where the alleged mafia boss had become a major player in the real estate sector.Apart from the interrogation of the VP’s husband, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa has been particularly quiet about what could be the biggest mafia arrest of the 21st century.Barbosa has been implicated in the 2018 election fraud scandal and appears to be more concerned with trying to keep his political allies out of prison than fighting crime.The arrest of Memo further puts pressure on Colombia’s elite that tries to come across as legitimate, but is confronted with mounting evidence they could be an elaborate front doing much of the money laundering for the local mafia.Colombia’s ambassador to Uruguay returns over cocaine labs found on family estateAccording to Migration statistics provided by the court, the alleged kingpin entered and left Colombia more than 100 times as authorities apparently had no idea of the real estate tycoon’s decades-long ties to organized crime, the private sector and political powerhouses. drug traffickingMemo Fantasma ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-jails-alleged-superspider-in-mafia-web/,Colombia jails alleged superspider in mafia web
" Colombia’s increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque rejected a damning human rights report by the Organization of American States (OAS).In its report, the OAS’ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) blasted the government’s excessive use of force to quell anti-government protests that kicked off on April 28.The violent repression has left dozens dead and an unknown number of people missing.The IACHR additionally recommended Colombia’s far-right government to adopt more than 40 measures to guarantee its citizens human rights and prevent abuses of power.Read the full IACHR report (Spanish)In his response, Duque said that “no one can recommend a country to be tolerant of criminal acts,” ignoring the OAS commission’s claim that the security forces and groups that had nothing to do with the largely peaceful protests were behind the violence.The Inter-American Commission expresses its firm condemnation and rejection of the high levels of violence registered in the context of social protest, caused both by the excessive use of force by the public security forces and that provoked by groups outside the protest itself.Inter-American Commission on Human RightsAccording to the government, the police cracked down on more than 1,700 protests in response to “acts of vandalism, low intensity urban terrorism” and “blockades that threaten the rights of citizens,” while allowing 89% of the more than 14,000 protests that started on April 28 to proceed in peace.This shows that the government of President Ivan Duque respects and guarantees peaceful public protest, which cannot, under any circumstances, be subject to vandalism, chaos and the destruction of Colombians’ property.Foreign MinistryThe foreign ministry ignored police collusion with armed anti-protest groups and rejected a decision by the IACHR to form a permanent commission to monitor the Duque administration’s respect for human rights.The OAS´ human rights commission previously created such a “Special Monitoring Mechanism on Human Rights Issues” for the increasingly authoritarian regimes of Nicaragua and Venezuela.Read the Colombian government’s rebuttal (Spanish)IACHR’s main issuesDuque’s false claim that the police had been acting against a “low intensity terrorism” campaign confirmed the IACHR’s concern about “the impact that polarization and stigmatization have on the human rights of protesters.”This OAS commission urged the government to abide by a 2020 Supreme Court order that banned the stigmatization of protests.THE IACHR additionally reminded the Colombian government it is supposed to provide security to citizens, instead of using force as if they were enemies.Citizen security cannot be based on a use of force paradigm that aims to treat the civilian population as the enemy, but must consist of the protection and control of civilians.Inter-American Commission on Human RightsIn order to protect instead of posing a threat to citizens, the iACHR recommended to transfer the National Police from the Defense Ministry to the Interior Ministry.Duque rejected this, claiming that the current structure had provided stability after a civil war between 1948 and 1958 when the military and the police found themselves fighting each other.Colombia has maintained this structure in a stable manner, correcting what for many years was highly questioned, and that is that during the years in which the Police was in the Ministry of Government it became politicized, and this politicization led to large outbreaks of violence.President Ivan DuqueThe president ignored the fact that Colombia suffered an armed conflict since 1964 that killed at least 265,000 people and left between 80,000 and 200,000 people missing.Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party has categorically denied Colombia’s armed conflict, claiming that the deadly violence was due to a “terrorist threat.”According to the IACHR, the current protests are not due to the government´s fictitious “low intensity terrorism” campaign, but “structural and historical demands of Colombian society” that “are enshrined in the 1991 Political Constitution and the 2016 Peace Accords.”The Foreign Ministry’s perhaps most absurd insinuation was that the OAS commission’s recommendations could further fuel instability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s broadly rejected response to the crisis.Duque all but completely isolated Colombia’s government due to the president’s increasingly dictatorial  tendencies and the his government’s increasingly evident ties to organized crime. diplomacyhuman rightsIACHRnational strikeOASpolice brutality ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-clashes-with-oas-over-damning-human-rights-report/,Colombia clashes with OAS over damning human rights report
" A subcommittee of the United States’ House of Representatives voted to conditionally approve aid to Colombia’s security forces after a surge in police brutality.The Subcommittee on Appropriations for Foreign Operations agreed to allocate $461 million in aid for the South American country, slightly more than the $453 million requested by the administration of President Joe Biden.The subcommittee added a novel condition to some $64 million of the aid package that is meant for the National Police and the National Army’s counternarcotics budget.The conditional aid is the equivalent of approximately 30% of the United States’ counternarcotics budget for Colombia.The counternarcotics funds for the National Police will only be transferred if the Department of State certifies that Colombian authorities are effectively investigating and punishing human rights violations committed by the security forces.The commander of the National Police, General Jorge Luis Vargas, has been fiercely criticized over the deaths of more than 80 people during anti-government protests that started in late April.Similar conditions were already in place in relation to aid to the National Army, which has been under pressure to effectively provide justice to victims of extrajudicial executions for years.The new condition is a victory for human rights organizations that have been lobbying for aid cuts to the National Police, whose human rights record has deteriorated significantly since the far-right President Ivan Duque took office in 2018.The new conditions on counternarcotics aid was promoted by democratic House Representative Jim McGovern, one of US Congress’  fiercest critics of human rights violations in Colombia.What is our responsibility here in the United States?… I and many of my colleagues have already called for the suspension of US direct assistance to Colombia’s National Police until we see judicial accountability for police brutality.House Representative Jim McGovernWhether the conditions approved by the subcommittee will take effect depends on whether the initiative makes it through the voting rounds in the House of Representatives and the Senate.The Americas director of Human Rights Watch, Jose Miguel Vivanco, called the decision “excellent news.”Duque and his Defense Minister Diego Molano did not immediately respond to the additional conditions on US aid for the security forces they have all but unconditionally supported. foreign aidNational PoliceUnited Statesus aid ",https://colombiareports.com/us-congress-adds-conditions-to-aid-to-colombia/,US Congress adds condition to aid to Colombia’s police
" While many in Colombia praise the kids who have protected anti-government protesters against police brutality, authorities are desperately trying to criminalize these so called “First Line” groups.According to Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, the collective of local groups are “gangs” and one is guilty of terrorism, though he failed to produce any evidence.Meanwhile, the chief prosecutor is under increasing pressure to investigate police brutality, which he has tried to avoid like the plague.One would almost feel sorry for Barbosa who has been at the center of controversy since taking office last year for bungling virtually all his responsibilities due to his mind-boggling incompetence.The troubled prosecutor hasn’t had the easiest job as hiding the evidence that links President Ivan Duque to drug traffickers is a lot cause, not to mention the evidence indicating that former President Alvaro Uribe is nothing but a mafioso.Prosecutor General Fransisco BarbosaThe First Line’s popularityMeanwhile, the First Line groups enjoy broad support in their respective communities, especially those who have suffered most from the extremely violent efforts to crack down on the protests.These urban communities have gone as far as providing the protesters with food and have praised the “First Liners” for their bravery in the face of almost unprecedented police brutality.A collective of defense attorneys, the “Judicial First Line,” has additionally gathered hundreds of of volunteers who provide the youthful protester with legal aid against the apparent persecution by the government.Unaccustomed to voluntary support for anti-government protesters, the prosecution has been trying to find evidence of illegal financing of these groups.Residents in Yopal preparing a community meal for the local First Line groups.Increasing evidence of a mafia governmentBabosa is clutching at straws as Defense Minister Diego Molano and General Jorge Luis Vargas of the National Police are facing accusations of committing crimes against humanity.Furthermore, regional police commanders throughout the country have been accused  of teaming up with armed civilians to to put an end to the protests.The commander of the Medellin Police on Saturday announced investigations into local cops for allegedly colluding with armed civilians in an operation to end protests on Saturday.Cali already lost its police chief after evidence emerged indicating he tried to cover up police collusion with armed civilians in an attack on indigenous protesters.Two weeks after a court ordered the prosecution to release protesters from the town of Armenia due to a lack of evidence, the prosecution on Monday again arrested alleged First Line protesters based solely on “presumptions”.Seven people who were captured were allegedly part of the self-styled Primera Línea in Armenia. It is presumed that they participated in acts of terrorism and vandalism in municipalities of Quindío.Prosecutor General’s OfficeThe collapse of the “Mafia puppet president”President Ivan Duque (Image: President’s Office)US lawmakers last week approved a resolution that blocked one third of the National Police’s counternarcotics budget until Barbosa effectively prosecutes police who allegedly murdered 40 protesters.The chief prosecutor has been trying to avoid doing exactly that as these prosecutions could lead to evidence of the high-level involvement in crimes against humanity as claimed by the opposition.Barbosa doesn’t seem to have either the capacity or the ability to protect the police or Duque, the chief prosecutor’s friend of more than 25 years.Meanwhile, there is no indication that First Line protest will end before the president leaves office in August next year to go down as the “worst president in history”.

" Colombia’s Inspector General’s Office on Thursday began investigating the role of military officials in an alleged car bomb attack inside an army base earlier this week.The military previously suspended several army officials of the 30th Brigade in Cucuta where 36 people were injured by a major explosion on Tuesday.According to the government, the blast was caused by a car bomb of either guerrilla group ELN or a group formed by dissidents of now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.Neither the ELN nor the dissident 33rd Front and “Nueva Marquetalia” formed by FARC dissidents claimed responsibility for the alleged attack.The three guerrilla groups are some of multiple illegal organizations that are active in the border region around Cucuta.The partial investigationThe inspector general investigation is meant to find out whether army officials’ negligence allowed guerrillas to drive the alleged car bomb into the military compound.Neither the Prosecutor General’s Office nor the Inspector General’s Office announced plans to investigate the possibility that the explosion was caused by an accident.Contradictory claims made by Defense Minister Diego Molano and Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa additionally fueled speculation about the possible involvement of the military in the blast.Molano and Barbosa on Wednesday announced the first results of the investigation in a fake press conference that was not attended by any journalists.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa (L) and Defense Minister Diego Molano during their fake press conference (Image: Defense Minister)The government’s contradictionsWednesday’s “press conference” left more questions than answers as the chief prosecutor blatantly contradicted claims made by the defense minister the night before.Molano said Tuesday that two men who identified themselves as state officials drove the car bomb into the 30th Brigade’s base less than three hours before the blast.Terrorists cannot continue to pose as peace managers abroad, while they commit atrocious acts against our soldiers and Colombians.Defense Minister Diego MolanoBarbosa said Wednesday that only one person drove the alleged car bomb and denied that this suspect faked being a state official.Security footage shown by government-loyal television network RCN showed that the car that later exploded was inspected by an army official before being allowed to enter the military compound.Two hours after entering the army base, the car was parked in front of the Support Structure office after which the driver left the military base, according to the prosecution.(Screenshot: RCN Television)Barbosa confirmed the defense minister’s claim that the car bomb was detonated twice, but said this happened at 3:01PM and 3:04PM instead of 3:10PM and 3:12PM as claimed by the minister.Images taken from the military base indicate that the first blast destroyed much of the car, but left a vehicle that was parked behind the alleged car bomb virtually unscathed.According to government-loyal newspaper El Tiempo, investigators found that “the initial explosion allowed the activation of evacuation protocols for personnel that was inside the base.”Videos and images published on social media indicated that second explosion was considerably bigger, and caused major damage to the buildings.According to the Prosecutor General, more than two kilometers of detonating cord was found at the site.Doubts about the government’s claimsThe contradictory claims made by Molano and Barbosa caused confusion and skepticism even among government-loyal journalists.According to the editor-in-chief of RCN Noticias, Jose Manuel Acevedo, “it’s becoming very difficult to believe that was happened at the brigade in Cucuta was a simply act of negligence.”The “prosecution and the defense ministry are working on the hypothesis that some officials were complicit in entering the car bomb,” the government-loyal journalist said on Twitter.Government critics had already coined a “false flag” conspiracy theory, which is formally not being investigated by the prosecution.Also the investigation of the Inspector General’s Office only seeks to clarify whether there has been negligence.

" Some 36 people were injured on Monday when an alleged car bomb exploded inside a military base in Cucuta, a city in northeast Colombia that borders Venezuela.President Ivan Duque announced an investigation into the explosion inside the base of the 30th Brigade where a small number of American soldiers were present, according to the US Embassy in Bogota.In a speech, Duque said authorities began investigating whether guerrilla group ELN or dissident members of the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group are behind the “terrorist attack”.The president offered a $135 thousand (COP500 million) reward for information that would lead to the perpetrators of the alleged attack.The US embassy did not confirm the explosion was caused by a car bomb, but confirmed that the Federal Bureau of Investigations would assist in the investigation into the incident.A recording of which the veracity could not be verified said the explosion was due to an accident.The confusion about whether the explosion was due to an accident or a car bomb is due to the fact that evidence indicates there was a fire before the explosion and authorities contradicted each other.Army sources initially told television network Caracol that there were two car bombs, which was contradicted by the US Embassy’s claim that spoke of only one explosion.The defense minister said that there was one car bomb that exploded twice and that three of the victims were seriously injured.Previous government claims that guerrillas would be behind anti-government protests have severely damaged the credibility of Duque and Molano.Disregarding whether the explosion was due to a guerrilla car bomb or an accident, the incident was another major blow for a security forces that have been severely criticized over recent human rights violations.

" Social media users took Colombia’s government conspiracy theories to a whole new level, suggesting Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could have attacked far-right President Ivan Duque.Defense Minister Diego Molano has been trying to convince the Colombian people that leftist guerrillas opened fire on a helicopter transporting the president on Friday.As per usual, Molano couldn’t produce a shred of evidence to sustain his theory, which Twitter users apparently interpreted as an invitation to coin their own conspiracy theories.Zuckerberg became a popular suspect after the commander of the National Police, General Jorge Luis Vargas, released two relatively generic sketches of the alleged suspects, one of whom looked somewhat like the Facebook CEO.The defense minister further inspired Colombians’ creativity by offering an extraordinary reward of almost $800 thousand for information that would lead to the shooters.Mark Zuckerberg (L) and National Police art.Apart from the police sketch, no evidence indicates that the Facebook CEO was in anyway implicated in the shooting that left minor damage to the armoured Blackhawk helicopter used by the president.Duque, his defense minister and Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa have slowly become a laughingstock for bungling evidence that would prove their ongoing conspiracy theories.The president embarrassed himself at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019 when he produced fabricated evidence to sustain his conspiracy theory that Venezuela’s government was “harboring terrorists” of guerrilla group ELN and dissident groups of now-defunct rebel group FARC.Duque hadn’t even left New York when local media revealed the attempt to deceive the international community gathered for the UN’s annual meeting.The president claimed two weeks ago that an explosion at the 30the Brigade in Cucuta was the result of a “cowardly terrorist attack” for which he also blamed the leftist guerrillas.The chief prosecutor general subsequently bungled an investigation into the explosion by releasing CCTV footage that showed the alleged bomber leaving the 30th Brigade’s army base almost an hour before allegedly placing a car bomb.Duque has had major difficulties not lying since the 2018 election race when he falsely claimed having obtained a Harvard degree.

" Historians agree that explorer Christopher Columbus never “discovered” the Americas, but scientists have never found out when exactly Colombia was discovered and by who.“The most antique artifacts from our country” are estimated to be 2,040 years old by archeologists from the Santander university who found the ceramics in the town of Guaca in December last year.The ceramics and tools provided unique insight in the life of Colombia’s inhabitants around the turn of the century, but also highlighted the lack of knowledge of possibly more than 20,000 years of national history.(Image: Santander University)The Chiribiquete revolutionLess than five years before the Guaca find, the carbon dating of paint, charcoal and bones in the southern Chiribiquete national park proved that humans traveled deep into Colombia some 19,500 years ago.Anthropologist Carlos Castaño, who has been investigating the Chiribiquete site since the 1990’s, has suggested that human may have been inhabiting this jungle region for a period in between 24,000 and 40,000 years.Castaño stressed that his unproven theory required more scientific research, which has arguably been more scarce than archeological sites in Colombia.In fact, the country’s most famous archeological site, the “List City,” may still be lost had it not been for the assassination of one of the members of the Sepulveda family, who discovered and looted the site.It wasn’t until after the murder inside the Lost City that authorities and archeologists discovered evidence of one of Colombia’s  greatest civilizations in history in 1976.One could argue that more than 90% of Colombia’s history is unknown because virtually nobody investigated the evidence that wasn’t destroyed by the Spanish.PIctograms at Chiribiquete are between 500 and 19,500 years old, according to scientists.The importance of ChiribiqueteCastaño’s recent discoveries in Chiribiquete added evidence that disprove the long held belief that humans didn’t cross from Asia to the Americas until the end of the last ice age some 13,000 years ago.The evidence found in southern Colombia indicated that humans were discovering South America more than 6,500 years earlier, adding credibility to the so-called “long chronology theory” that proposed the discovery of the Americas could have begun more than 40,000 years ago.Genetic evidence that been gathered over the past few decades indicated that Colombia was likely discovered by people moving from North America through Central America and the Caribbean, and possibly following a Pacific naval route.Archeological evidence indicates that civilizations like that of the San Agustin culture began forming some 5,000 years ago.The people who discovered ColombiaThe languages spoken by native Colombians do not indicate who were first to discover the country or when.Linguists have distinguished languages that belong to three language trees in Colombia, Chibcha, Quecha and Arawakan.The Chibcha language family tree apparently originated from Costa Rica and is related to indigenous languages spoken on the Caribbean coast, the Magdalena river valley and the high plains around Bogota.Chibcha languagesQuecha languages that are spoken in southwestern Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru indicated a second migration wave that followed the Pacific coast.The absence of these languages in Colombia’s Andean region may be explained by theories that some of the South American explorers may have used Pacific naval routes.This naval migration theory is not supported by evidence.Quecha languagesArawak languages that are spoken in Colombia’s northern La Guajira province and throughout the Amazon forest.Arawak languages What is clear is that many of the ancestors of the peoples speaking these variations of these languages migrated into South America through Colombia.Which of the people speaking any of these languages discovered Colombia is a mystery. One can only guess if these languages spread through migration or cultural integration.The people who settled in Chiribiquete could have spoken a form of Arawak or a language that was replaced by what is now the most dominant language in the Amazon forest.Most of the few archaeological findings that could support theories about the discovery of Colombia weren’t made until the 21st century.Historically, local scientists have shown little interest in finding out who discovered the country and founded the civilizations that were all but destroyed by the Spanish. culturehistoryindigenous issues ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-a-country-with-no-history-of-its-civilizations/,Colombia: a country with no history of its civilizations
" Colombia’s former President Juan Manuel Santos on Friday asked forgiveness for the mass killing of civilians by the military when the Nobel Peace prize laureate was defense minister.In a hearing by the Truth Commission, the former president admitted that the military under his command assassinated “young people who should be alive today. This should never have happened. I acknowledge this.”I apologize to all the mothers and families who were victims of this horror from the depths of my soul. May this never happen again.Former President Juan Manuel SantosSantos was the defense minister of former President Alvaro Uribe between 2007 when the mass executions of innocent civilians peaked and the former president dismissed reports on the killings as attempts to discredit the security forces.The former president was forced to take action in 2008 when international press exposed evidence that was impossible to deny.By then, the mass killing of innocent civilians had cost the lives of more than 6,400 innocent civilians, according to war crimes tribunal JEP.Victims of extrajudicial executionsThe former president won a Nobel Peace Prize for a 2016 peace agreements with now-defunct FARC guerrillas, but is “left with the remorse, the deep regret, that during my ministry many, many mothers, including those of Soacha, lost their children to this ruthless practice,” said Santos.The former president said that he tried to put an end to the mass killing of civilians while in office as defense minister, which caused tensions with Uribe.Truth Commission President Francisco de Roux told press that he hoped that Santos’ predecessor would also appear before the commission and ask forgiveness.I do hope that former President Uribe apologizes for what happened in his government with the false positives, but that is his business. We cannot force anyone, we are not judges.Truth Commission president Francisco De RouxUribe has categorically downplayed the mass executions though and has fiercely opposed the peace process with the FARC of which the truth Commission and the JEP are part.The former president is already being investigated for his alleged complicity in two paramilitary massacres, a homicide, witness tampering and election fraud to rig the 2018 elections in favor of President Ivan Duque. armed conflictfalse positiveshuman rightsJuan Manuel Santospeace processtruth commissionWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-former-president-asks-forgiveness-for-executing-civilians/,Colombia’s former president asks forgiveness for mass killing of civilians
" Colombia’s culture ministry removed statues of 15th-century explorer Christopher Columbus and Spain’s late Queen Isabella amid fears they would be tumbled.Government workers removed the statues from their pedestals in the capital Bogota on Friday after native Colombian protesters tried to tumble them on Wednesday.The attempts triggered tensions with a fringe white supremacist group that subsequently tried to attack the protesters of the Misak people from southwest Colombia.White supremacy in Colombia | Part 1: Kill the Indians!According to the Culture Ministry, the statues that were erected in 1906 were taken to a safe place for “a process of restauration.”(Image: Wikipedia)The National Patrimony agency said that it would hold talks with different social sectors about the future of the European explorer and the late monarch who financed the naval adventure that led Columbus to the Americas.The statues were erected to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus’ “discovery” of the western hemisphere centuries after Viking explorers from Iceland.The native Colombians celebrated the decision on Saturday by victoriously climbing the empty pedestals of the late Italian explorer and his Spanish financial patron.Misak protesters in BogotaThe Misak people have been tumbling statues associated with the Spanish colonization of the Americas and the extermination of indigenous people since anti-government protests began in late April.The statues of Spanish conquistadors have long been deeply offensive to many native Colombians but weren’t targeted by the native Colombians until this year.The tumbling of the statues triggered mixed reactions as late conquistador Sebastian De Belalcazar is both the founder of cities like Cali and Popayan and one of the most notorious leaders of the 16-century holocaust of native Colombians.Tumbled statue of Sebastian de Belalcazar in CaliIn a statement, the Misak said Saturday that they would continue to assume their “ancestral responsibility to clean those  clean colonial wounds and seek the healing of all colonial wounds.”History is a device of power told from the voice of the oppressors, which is why we have been forced to reconfigure the colonial past that reflects practical ideology and actions that seek to annihilate diversity.Misak spokespersonColumbus fell out of grace after evidence confirmed the Vikings were the first Europeans to cross the Atlantic and many countries in Latin America began celebrating their native and black people on what is called “Columbus Day” in the United States.Some among Colombia’s white majority continue to consider Columbus and even controversial characters like Belalcazar as part of their cultural identity.

" Colombia’s vice-president on Tuesday implied that 40,000 weapons were seized from anti-government protesters as the government began drowning in criminal charges.Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez made the claim after she was heard by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) over alleged crimes against humanity committed to quell the protests.Ramirez told press that “the security forces have had to seize 40,000 weapons. These are people who went out to protest, not peacefully, but armed and with the intention of destroying things.”According to the Defense Ministry, almost 46,000 “corrective measures” were taken against people for carrying knives or sharp objects since the protests began on April 28.These fines are unrelated to the protests, but the VP and the Defense Ministry are trying to associate every single misdemeanor committed in Colombia to the anti-government protests.The government of far-right President Ivan Duque has every reason to be desperate as the IACHR on Tuesday began hearings about crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Defense Minister Diego Molano and the security forces.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa twisted and turned, but was ultimately forced to admit that 921 of the 1,136 arrested protesters were released after courts found they were tried on bogus charges.In fact, courts approved the arrest of only 88 protesters while 429 cops are being investigated on charges of abuse or assault, according to the chief prosecutor.Barbosa, a personal friend of Duque, tried to evade investigating the violent repression of the protests, but his prosecutors have had the worst luck in court.In multiple cases, prosecution attempts to seek court approval for the arrest of protesters ended in court orders to open criminal investigations against cops.Human rights organizations handed the IACHR a report alleging that 1,649 protesters were illegally detained by the police and that members of the security forces were involved in 41 murders.Almost 1,250 protesters were tortured and 25 women were sexually abused by cops, according to the report, which alerted the IACHR that 356 protesters were forcibly disappeared.Opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda pressed criminal charges against Molano and National Security Adviser Rafael Guarin for their alleged role in crimes against humanity that sought to quell protests.The violent repression failed to end the protests, but sunk the approval rating of the president to the lowest point in polling history and triggered voices in US Congress to cut military aid to Colombia’s security forces. human rightsIACHRMarta Lucia Ramireznational strike ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-desperately-implies-peaceful-protesters-were-armed-to-the-teeth/,Colombia desperately implies peaceful protesters were armed to the teeth

They are being reviewed and many are released without any kind of legal procedure.Human rights defenderAccording to the human rights defender, the majority of young people who have been in the clandestine jails ended up there without having committed any crimes.The majority of the alleged victims of the Cali Police Department’s illegal detention practices have been released, said the human rights defender who urged national and international authorities to intervene.Colombia’s third largest city has suffered the most violent repression of protests against the increasingly tyrannical President Ivan Duque that kicked off on April 28.More than half of the protesters who have been assassinated by police or armed government supporters during the protests were murdered in Cali, according to think tank Indepaz.Canal 2 previously discovered that a local branch of supermarket chain Exito was being used as an operation center by police and armed civilians.An inspection team that included human rights officials filmed bloods spatters in different parts of the supermarket.Authorities have been reluctant to investigate the disappearance of hundreds of people in Cali and the alleged existence of mass graves in cities close to the capital of the Valle del Cauca province.Attempts to brutally crack down on protests against far-right President Ivan Duque have triggered criminal charges against Defense Minister Diego Molano and National Security Adviser Rafael Guarin.Duque and his top security officials have refused to acknowledge the mass human rights violations, but have coined a baseless conspiracy theory claiming that ongoing protests against the regime are part of a “low intensity terrorism” campaign.

" President Ivan Duque’s order to militarize parts of Colombia is unconstitutional and likely to aggravate the country’s social crisis, according to a legal expert.Duque ordered the militarization of eight of the country’s 32 provinces on Saturday in response to road blocks that have been erected throughout the country in opposition of the president’s increasingly authoritarian rule.In an opinion piece published by political news website La Silla Vacia, Rodrigo Uprimmy of judicial think tank Dejusticia said that the decree that orders local and regional authorities to remove the roadblocks with “military assistance” violates of the constitution.According to Uprimmy, the president ignored the fact that roadblocks are a legal form of protest unless they affect humanitarian transport like that of food supplies and ambulances.The decree also ignored the fact that civilian authorities may only use force as a last resort if a roadblock is illegal, Uprimmy said.Last but not least, Duque’s “military assistance” is a term invented by the government that lacks any legal definition, according to the legal expert.If Uprimmy is correct, the Constitutional Court will sink the decree after studying whether the president is acting within the law.Duque’s negotiator with the organizers of national strikes that triggered all kinds of anti-government protests after April 28 said Tuesday that the withdrawal of the controversial decree is not up for negotiation.The National Strike Committee has demanded the withdrawal of this decree as one of the guarantees allowing peaceful protest against Colombia’s least popular president in recorded history.These talks are unlikely to go anywhere until either Duque or the high court withdraws the decree that plunged negotiations in crisis.In the meantime, governors and mayors have continued to negotiate with protesters to end roadblocks in an apparent attempt to neither break the law nor increase tensions with Duque. executive ordermilitarynational strike ",https://colombiareports.com/duques-order-to-militarize-parts-of-colombia-unconstitutional/,Duque’s order to militarize parts of Colombia ‘unconstitutional’
" Social leaders who are at the forefront of ongoing anti-government protests on Sunday ended negotiations with Colombia’s far-right government for purposely delaying talks.After some 40 days of talks, the National Strike Committee suspended negotiations with presidential adviser Emilio Archila.The labor unions, student leaders and farmers organizations that make up the committee said the increasingly tyrannical President Ivan Duque was responsible for the failing of talks.The National Strike Committee has insistently stated that the national government is not interested and has purposely delayed the negotiation of the Emergency Plan.National Strike CommitteeArchila told press that “we, the Government, are ready” after initially backing out a a draft agreement on an “emergency plan” that would guarantee peaceful protests.Since the brutal repression of the committee’s first day of strikes on April 28, anti-government protests not associated with the strikes have erupted all over Colombia.The National Police, the National Army and armed government supporters have since consistently used deadly force to crack down on the protests and uprisings.Human Rights Watch Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco said last week that his NGO was verifying “credible reports about 67 deaths that occurred during the protests.”Police massacre protesters in southwest ColombiaAccording to the Ombudsman’s Office, 129 people were disappeared after the Search Unit for Missing Persons said that 379 protesters had gone missing during the protests.Multiple organizations have accused the police and the prosecution of carrying out mass arbitrary arrests.

" President Ivan Duque lost control over Colombia as mounting evidence of his alleged ties to organized crime gradually eroded the government’s legitimacy.The first evidence of the the president’s corruption and ties to organized crime emerged before his 2018 election already.While still on campaign, Duque was caught falsifying his CV and the Supreme Court opened a criminal investigation into the president’s boss, former President Alvaro Uribe.Furthermore, Duque’s support from politicians with proven ties to drug traffickers caused concern that the “Uribista” candidate was a “mafia puppet.”Ivan Duque, the mafia’s puppet?Evidence of widespread election fraud in the congressional election triggered Supreme Court fraud investigations against multiple of the president’s allies.The National Registry refused to investigate evidence of widespread fraud in the presidential elections, which severely eroded Duque’s perceived legitimacy ahead of his inauguration.A controversial tax reform proposal sank the president’s approval to below 30% before the end of 2019.Duque’s misrule led to a devastating defeat for Uribe’s Democratic Center party in the 2019 local elections and the biggest anti-government protests in more than four decades in November of that year.Colombia’s national strike: the beginning of the end of Ivan DuqueThe government tried to quell the protests with extreme violence, which fueled anti-government sentiment and further destroyed Duque’s approval rating.Early last year, independent media revealed evidence that Uribe and Duque conspired with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 elections, plunging the president’s approval to below 25%.The coronavirus pandemic prevented a resurgence of protests and allowed Duque to hold off negotiating with the National Strike Committee that had organized the mass protests.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersThe president’s response to the devastating consequences of the pandemic as well as mounting evidence of corruption with coronavirus funds further deteriorated support for Duque.The National Strike Committee announced a new strike for April 28 after former Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla again proposed a tax reform.The turnout for the protest wasn’t even close to the first protests until the security forces responded with even more brutality than in 2019.The police brutality triggered anti-government protests perhaps even bigger than the one in 2019 and Duque’s approval rating dropped to a level unseen in history.Meanwhile, the president’s legal problems mushroomed as he found himself charged with crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court while already being investigated for his ties to narcos.Charges pressed against Colombia’s government before International Criminal CourtDuque was no longer considered a mafia puppet, but widely perceived as a tin-pot-dictator who had converted the government in an organized crime organization.Colombia’s society wasn’t having any of this and rose up.The mayors and governors who defeated the Uribistas in 2019 took charge of restoring order and preventing the first presidential lynching in history. executive orderIvan Duquenational strike ",https://colombiareports.com/how-colombias-president-went-from-weak-to-powerless/,How Colombia’s president lost his legitimacy

" Talks to end protests and uprisings against Colombia’s far-right president Ivan Duque were suspended on Sunday after the government backed out of previously made agreement.The suspension of the talks further deepen the crisis and increase the risk of more violence that has killed dozens of protesters, two policemen and one prosecution official since April 28.The National Strike Committee, which has organized peaceful protests, said the government refused to sign off on a previous draft agreement to end the violent repression of protest.The social organizations reiterated they will continue to be available for talks to end the protests and uprisings that have expanded and become more chaotic in response to extreme police brutality.The government said in a press release that it wanted the National Strike Committee to lift roadblocks that have been spontaneously been put up by people throughout the country without the knowledge of the social leaders.Ahead of the talks, Duque ordered the militarization of eight Colombia’s 32 provinces where these often illegal roadblocks are seriously affecting the transport of food supplies or the free movement of ambulances.In its statement, the social organizations demanded the withdrawal of the presidential decree ordering to expand the militarization contrary to the previously made agreement.The National Strike Committee called for “huge peaceful demonstrations in the entire country” for Wednesday in another attempt to break the latest deadlock.According to analyst Elizabeth Dickinson of the International Crisis Group, “nascent trust” between the protest organizers and the government was “shattered” after the breakdown of talks.The social organizations said they agreed to resume talks on Tuesday. Contrary to evidence, the government said it “has been and will be fully motivated to sit down and seek agreements,” but didn’t confirm whether it would resume talks on Tuesday.Instead, the government said “we hope that the community leaders accept out invitation to… talk, but without strike or blockages.” national strike ",https://colombiareports.com/talks-to-end-protests-and-uprisings-in-colombia-suspended/,Talks to end protests and uprisings in Colombia suspended
" Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque has made history by becoming the country’s least popular president since Gallup began polling.Critics’ claim that Duque is Colombia’s “worst president in history” was partially validated by pollster Gallup, which released its latest poll on Monday.According to Gallup, the tin-pot-dictator’s disapproval rating reached a historic level of 76%, breaking the 20-year record of former President Andres Pastrana, one of Duque’s allies.Also the president’s 18% approval rating is the lowest since Gallup began polling in 1994.Duque’s approval ratingDuque has been struggling to find public approval since taking office in 2018, but took government misrule to a whole new level in the month leading up to ongoing anti-government protest.The president’s third proposed tax reform sunk Duque’s approval rating to an almost historic 20% low in April.The security forces’ use of extreme violence and terrorism to quell anti-government protests that kicked off on April 28 failed, but apparently secured the president’s entry in the history books.Ever since taking office, Duque has tried to compensate his ineptitude with government propaganda, which has been as unsuccessful as the president’s attempt to falsify his academic credentials and attempts to govern.The approval rating of the president’s informal boss, former President Alvaro Uribe, also dropped to a historic 20% low as both appear to be destroying their far-right Democratic Center party ahead of the 2022 elections.Uribe’s approval rating was already suffering from ongoing investigations into the former president’s alleged organized crime activity.The former president’s attempts to criminalize opposition and public protest against his puppet all but destroyed the once almighty Uribe.Whether either will be able to recover remains to be seen as Duque is set to start negotiating with the leaders of national strikes that have triggered anti-government protests.The failed attempt to violently repress the protests evaporated the president’s political capital and left the government without leverage to negotiate the far-reaching changes in economic policy demanded by the protest organizers. approval ratingsIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/ivan-duque-colombias-least-popular-president-in-polling-history/,Ivan Duque: Colombia’s least popular president in polling history
" Colombia’s judges and prosecutors laid down work on Tuesday to join a two-day national strike in opposition to far-right President Ivan Duque.Multiple judicial labor unions and associations said they would join anti-government protests that will enter their fifth week on Wednesday.In a press release, the National Association of Judicial Branch Employees (Asonal) said that “we also reject the disproportionate police repression against those who peacefully exercise their fundamental right to protest.”Eight judicial associations said in a joint statement that they would lay down work in protest of the “inadequate institutional response to the demands of the population.”Asonal specifically blasted the “submissive and negligent” attitude of the Inspector General and the Ombudsman, who were already under fire over their response to police brutality.The judicial workers will be joining protests organized by the National Strike Committee whose April 28 strike triggered four weeks of anti-government protests throughout Colombia.The first two-day strike since the beginning of the protests comes a day after negotiators of the National Strike Committee and the government agreed on a draft agreement that would guarantee peaceful protests.The National Strike Committee, which represents students, farmers and labor unions, has refused to begin negotiations on their demands for far-reaching economic reforms until the government ends violent repression.During the first four weeks of protest, human rights organization Temblores received almost 3,000 reports of police brutality.Alleged cases of police brutalitySecurity forces allegedly assaulted 855 protestersPolice allegedly killed 43 protestersPolice allegedly detained 1,264 protesters illegallyPolice violently cracked down on 575 peaceful protestsPolice bullets allegedly injured 153 peoplePolice allegedly sexually assaulted 21 womenAnother six people reported gender-based violenceThe Missing Persons Search Unit additionally raised the alarm after hundreds of protesters went missing.Human rights NGO Justicia y Paz said locals from the area around Cali, Colombia’s third largest city, reported police has been dumping the bodies of executed protesters in mass graves.While the strikes organized by the National Strike Committee have been largely peaceful, there have been a growing number of reports of violent protests and even attacks on members of the loathed National Police.Duque’s response to the strikes has made him the least popular president in the history of polling in Colombia.

" Public support for Colombia’s mass media has plummeted as they persistently contradict citizen reporting, a poll confirmed.According to pollster Invamer, public approval of the news media dropped from 41% to 31% since ongoing anti-government protests began on April 28.The approval of “the media” in Colombia has been dropping for a decade, but plummeted in May after a wave of social media reports on police brutality was blatantly contradicted by mass media.Media approvalColombians become their own reportersWhile citizens reported extreme violence by the security forces on social media, Colombia’s mass media almost exclusively reported on incidents of vandalism by “protesters.”On some days, citizens were literally begging the international community for help while media were replicating a government conspiracy theory that the largely peaceful protests would be coordinated by guerrilla groups.The crimes against humanity reported by citizens triggered a wave of international indignation and motion of confidence against Defense Minister Diego Molano based exclusively on citizen reports.Colombia trying to cover up attempted indigenous massacreAlien mediaIn one case, media replicated unsubstantiated claims that native Colombian victims of an attempted massacre in Cali were vandalizing “citizens'” property.Violence in Cali escalated to the point that residents of Colombia’s third largest city asked foreign correspondents not to leave, claiming they were afraid that police terror would resume.Last week, television network RCN reported on “20 days of roadblocks and vandalism,” while the vast majority of protests of the past month were entirely peaceful.Earlier this month, the network claimed food prices in Bogota were “a lot more expensive” after a shopkeeper told the reporter that prices had gone down.Reporter: Good afternoon. You were talking to me about lime and cassava. Shopkeeper: Good afternoon, miss. Yes, the price of lime at the moment has dropped a bit and is at a relatively normal price. Reporter: How expensive is it? Let’s say, if I take five limes? Shopkeeper: Between 1,500 or 2,000 pesos, depending on the size of the lime. Reporter: And how much was it last week?

" One of Colombia’s leading opposition forces demanded the resignation of President Ivan Duque’s national security adviser  after attacking government critics on social media.In a series of tweets, National Security Adviser Rafael Guarin claimed on Wednesday that “we cannot allow they disguise crime as protests or justify violence with protests.”On Tuesday, the national security adviser accused opposition Senator Gustavo Petro of being an “instigator of violence” who “dreams of massacres.”Opposition politicians of Petro’s “Historic Pact” demanded the resignation of Guarin, claiming his tweets were “slanderous.”According to the opposition politicians, the national security adviser “uses his social networks as a platform for attacks against opposition leaders.”Guarin is a loyal ally of far-right President Alvaro Uribe, who resigned from Congress in August last year to evade Supreme Court investigations into the former Medellin Cartel associate’s criminal practices.The former president has been coining all kinds of conspiracy theories to justify the use of violence against anti-government protesters and is currently being investigated in charges he filed fraudulent criminal charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda.Colombia’s former president ‘glorifying violence’: TwitterDuque, who is widely considered Uribe’s puppet, has been dealt major political blows by the protests since they began on April 28.Two ministers have resigned, the increasingly authoritarian president was forced to withdraw a tax reform proposal and Congress sunk the government’s healthcare reform bill on Wednesday.Duque and his Defense Minister Diego Molano have additionally received fierce international criticism over the use of extreme violence to quell the protests.Colombia’s military allegedly aiding armed civilians and vandalsHuman Rights Watch Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco said Tuesday that he had received “chilling” reports of the murder of 55 protesters.

" Deeply-rooted racism of the white elite in Colombia’s third largest city Cali poses a genocide risk for the local black community, according to a study.Cali found itself in the spotlight during ongoing anti-government protests because of extreme violence that human rights NGO CODHES attributed to racist policing and an armed white elite.The city has a long history of institutionalized racism and white supremacy that has its origin in the city’s leading role in Colombia’s exploitation of slaves in sugar plantations of the Valle del Cauca province.The recent surge of violence against Cali’s black community “runs the risk of becoming a genocide” unless measures are taken, according to CODHES.Cali’s former police chief resigned earlier this month after evidence of policemen colluding with armed civilians who indiscriminately opened fire on native Colombians.Colombia trying to cover up attempted indigenous massacreBeing black in CaliSlaves at a sugar plantation near Cali. (Image: La Bolsa estate)Some 170 years after the abolishment of slavery, Cali has the second-largest black community of Latin America’s cities.This is a region of former slave plantations. But also of captaincies that controlled the indigenous people of the Cauca region were controlled. The church and the landowners were involved.Social scientist Fernando UrreaThis city’s Afrocolombian community has grown bigger since the 1990’s because of the influx of black communities who were displaced from the Pacific coast by armed conflict.This influx of victims of displacement made poor neighborhoods even more predominantly black and rich neighborhoods even more exclusively white than they traditionally were.The consequence amplified a racial segregation that CODHES called “territorial racialization,” which normalized white supremacy, criminalized Colombia’s largest urban black community and fueled mutual resentment.The “territorial racialization” and criminalization of Afrodescendant neighborhoods and territories is built on negative stereotypes and racist ideologies about Afro-descendant peoples and communities. This “territorial racialization” fuels and normalizes exclusion, social injustice, and violence, as well as the excessive use of force and racial profiling by the police in Afrodescendant neighborhoods.CODHESMedia stigmatization of young black people, especially those taking part in protests, “undoubtedly seeks to reduce the deaths associated with the protests while simultaneously justifying the deaths of black and marginalized youth.”Protests in Colombia turn deadly: police massacres ‘at least 8’ in CaliCali’s “territorial racialization”The invisible suffering of Cali’s black communityOf all Colombia’s urban communities, Cali’s black inhabitants may have been the hardest hit by the coronavirus and the economic consequences of the pandemic.While other cities tried to keep tabs on outbreaks per neighborhood, Cali’s notoriously corrupt health authorities did not, making the impact on vulnerable communities invisible and a differentiated approach impossible.The city’s poverty rate surged from 21.2% in 2019 to 36.3% last year, but Cali authorities also failed to monitor the humanitarian situation per neighborhood.The police’s monitoring of violent crime only recently made it clear that the predominantly black neighborhoods had been suffering extreme increases in violence.Protests in Colombia turn deadly: police massacre ‘at least 8’ in CaliThe bomb explodesWhen President Ivan Duque’s proposed tax reform that threatened to worsen the situation for Cali’s black community in April, a call for a national strike was welcomed with particular urgency among the city’s black inhabitants.While in most cities protests were relatively organized and concentrated, protests in Cali broke out throughout the city, particularly in and on the borders of black neighborhoods.Black communities – and particularly black youth – are at the forefront of these protests because they encounter the effects of systemic racism every day. They are forcing Colombia to reckon with the living legacy of enslavement.CODHES investigator Harrinson CueroThe Cali Police Department responded immediately and with particular brutality, especially in black neighborhoods.Within hours, Defense Minister also sent in the military after which violence against the communities only got worse.Colombia fighting violent repression of anti-government protestsKill them niggers(Image: Proceso de Comunidades Negras en Colombia)According to CODHES, 31 of the 51 people who were killed in Colombia since the protests began on April 28 were murdered in Cali.Another 112 of the 152 people who were forcibly disappeared in Cali during the strike continue to be missing.The Cali Police Department and the National Army pushed the municipal authorities’ racism to a whole new level by unleashing violence unseen anywhere in Colombia.The excessive use of force and disproportionate violence in neighborhoods with a “high” and “medium” Afrodescendant population is related to “territorial racialization” and racial profiling in the aforementioned Afrodescendant communities.CODHESThe extreme violence confirmed “a clear pattern of racist policing underpinned by racial profiling and the criminalization of black communities” they had been suffering since slavery.The excessive use of force particularly in majority black areas of Cali to repress the current social protest, is just one more example of the disproportionate state violence that black communities have faced historically.CODHES investigator Esther OjulariThe report did not elaborate on the alleged participation of armed civilians in violence against protesters and ethnic minorities in particular.One far-right group, the Anti-Communist brigade, has been openly recruiting on Twitter claiming it works together with security forces to carry out violent attacks against “vandals.”A second group, “Cali Fuerte,” which appears to consist of policemen and armed civilians, reportedly has also been involved in armed attacks.Following the explosion of violence and the uprising of black Colombians, Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina embarked on a peace promotion campaign and reallocated funds to alleviate suffering the the predominantly black neighborhoods.

" Television network RCN needed less than three minutes to imply that armed conflict victims may be part of a communist plot to destroy the paradise Colombia was while at war.Friday evening’s news broadcast failed to inform the public on what was happening in Colombia, but gave a unique insight into RCN’s increasingly hilarious conspiracy theories, live bloopers and utter nonsense.After a collage of random acts of vandalism, viewers were told about the “serious consequences” and housewives’ fear of “more than 20 days of road blocks and vandalism” that threaten more than 100,000 jobs.The alleged vandalism and the 37 roadblocks reported by the defense minister are relatively uncommon incidents, but allowed the television network not to report on protests against President Ivan Duque and RCN itself.Vandalizing Colombia’s corporate mediaDefense Minister Diego Molano claimed earlier that 2,151 roadblocks had been removed, which the television claimed was four times 37.According to the television network, farmers lost almost $350 million (COP1.3 trillion) because of the roadblocks, based on an unsubstantiated claim by the Colombian Agricultural Society, the country’s longest-living fascist association of landowners.To aggravate the crisis, the port of the Pacific coastal city Buenaventura lost $35 million (COP130 billion), said RCN, ignoring reports that five people were murdered in the port city.In “some” of Colombia’s food distribution centers, wholesale food prices had gone up 400%, lawmakers and international observers learned was due to corporations using the crisis to make quick buck.In Buenaventura, this price increase was due to extortion by illegal armed groups as Colombia Reports reported in January.Colombia news anchor scorned after claiming media ‘are not to inform or anything’Controversial riot police unit ESMAD began broadcasting operations live on social media because of the credible allegations police murdered more than 55 citizens over the past few weeks, which RCN called “irregularities.”To counter the bulk of evidence of the riot police unit’s widespread human rights violations, the ESMAD and the television decided to broadcast the attacks on civilians as filmed by the police.Several “agitators” were arrested on undisclosed criminal charges, according to RCN, implying they could add to the more than 1,260 alleged arbitrary detentions of innocent civilians reported by human rights NGO Temblores just hours earlier.The television network additionally reported on negotiations between Duque’s far-right government and the organizers of National Strikes that is all but tumbling the government.These negotiations have yet to results in the government agreeing not to violate human rights as Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos demands strike organizers to take responsibilities for roadblocks they have nothing to do with.To further illustrate how the apocalypse is rapidly approaching, RCN provided news consumers replicated a far-right conspiracy theory claiming that congressional seats granted to armed conflict victims “could end up in the hands of the FARC,” the guerrilla group that demobilized in 2017.A technical glitch cut short the television network’s report about Duque’s latest defeat in court that ordered the president to reveal how much he spent on COVID-19 vaccines.The report that fortunately did make it to the end was the arrest of a former governor in Spain on charges he was involved in human trafficking and the sexual abuse of children.Colombia’s recently appointed Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez traveled to New York to improve strained ties with US President Joe Biden, according to RCN, but was apparently ignored by the US government.This segment was also cut short just Ramirez was saying something about “human ri….”Last but not least, fighting between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas indicated that extreme violence is also happening in other parts of the world, and not just on Colombia’s most delusional corporate television network. journalismmediaRCN TV/Radio ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-television-news-16-minutes-of-apocalyptical-horror/,Colombia’s television news: 16 minutes of apocalyptical horror
" Colombia’s police are under immense pressure over mounting evidence and testimonies indicating anti-government protesters in Cali were executed and buried in mass graves.The security secretary of Colombia’s third largest city, Carlos Alberto Rojas, on Monday announced a “study” into the alleged disappearance of people during anti-government protests in Cali.Rojas took to the press after a report by human rights organization Justicia y Paz, which claimed it had received reports of mass graves in the cities of Buga and Yumbo “where the bodies of many young people were taken.”The people who have shared their testimony indicated that the youths were detained, some of them have been reported missing by their friends or families, and in Guacari, in Buga, 45 minutes from Cali, they were executed. Some of the survivors of the executions were found with gunshot wounds in health centers and today are terrified and in hiding. Today, May 23, a more delicate version of the operations of the groups of armed civilians protected by the police became known.

" Colombia’s increasingly tyrannical President Ivan Duque appears to be losing control as more and more public officials are turning on the government.Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos announced his resignation on Saturday while claiming that former President Alvaro Uribe, Duque’s informal boss, was illegally usurping the top official’s responsibilities.In an interview with government-loyal newspaper El Tiempo, Ceballos accused Uribe of interfering with attempts to resume peace talks with guerrilla group ELN that were suspended by the president after taking office in 2018.On two occasions, unfortunately, I was not consulted by former President Uribe in a couple of contacts he and his representatives had with the ELN…. A first during a trip to Cuba by one of his representatives… and a second time in which he met with Mr. Juan Carlos Cuellar, recently appointed peace manager.Outgoing Peace Commissioner Miguel CeballosThe outgoing peace commissioner’s comments confirm claims previously made by ELN negotiators, but had been officially denied.Ceballos’ resignation comes in the middle of negotiations with leaders of anti-government protests that are further eroding the authority of Duque, Defense Minister Diego Molano and Prosecutor General Francisco Molano.Molano claimed earlier this month that arms found during a raid in Cali were used during anti-government protests, which was denied by the prosecutor investigating the alleged arms traffickers.Cali prosecutor Giraldo Marin rejected the minister’s claims and said “I hope they file criminal charges against him,” Noticias Uno reported on Sunday.I have never said that they took part in vandalism or the social protests. In fact, let me put on the record that I don’t have anything to do with what Minister Molano said. That’s his problem and I hope they file charges against him.Cali prosecutor Giraldo MarinThe labor union of the judicial branch announced that it would join upcoming national strikes that are planned for Tuesday and Wednesday.Molano is expected to appear before Congress on Tuesday to face a motion of no confidence for the defense minister’s alleged responsibility in crimes against humanity to crack down on the anti-government protests that began on April 28.Molano, Duque, and the commanders of the National Police and the National Army had already been accused of crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court.Opposition politicians additionally announced criminal charges against National Security Adviser Rafael Guarin for making baseless claims that opposition Senator Gustavo Petro was an “instigator of violence and “dreaming of massacres.”Meanwhile, the Supreme Court continues to investigate Uribe for allegedly masterminding a conspiracy between his party and a drug trafficking organization to commit election fraud to favor the president in the 2018 elections.Protest organizers and local authorities are having increasing difficulties to curb escalating violence as illegal armed groups have begun using the protests to attack the security forces.

" Colombia’s defense minister is facing increasing pushback over his baseless claims that guerrillas are behind swelling anti-government protests.Defense Minister Diego Molano found himself being contradicted by the governor of the Cauca province, Elias Laharrondo, on Saturday after claiming that four community leaders were dissidents of the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group.Molano claimed that the social leaders were behind violent protest that broke out in Cauca capital Popayan on Friday in response to the suicide of a 17-year-old girl who claimed she was sexually abused by the police.Teenage suicide sparks deadly uprising in southwest ColombiaThe defense minister has consistently blamed FARC dissidents and ELN guerrillas for the protests since they began on April 28.Molano desperately needs evidence of guerrilla involvement because the defense minister deployed the military to the country’s largest cities and almost 50 people were killed.Unfortunately for Molano, he hasn’t been able to produce a shred of evidence to support his conspiracy theories and the community leaders are renowned for their social work.The defense minister, on the other hand, is facing criminal charges, a motion of no confidence and a possible foreign military aid cuts over the security forces alleged human rights violations in response to the protests.To add insult to injury, the violence has dramatically increased support for the protests and destroyed support for President Ivan Duque, who is now dealing with a government crisis.Colombia’s anti-government protests swell to historic proportionsMolano has been running around Colombia like a headless chicken as the urban protests have been accompanies by rural protests in which major highways were blocked.According to a poll released by weekly Semana on Sunday, 81% of Colombians disapprove of how the government has responded to the strike and the subsequent protests.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque refused to immediately give in to social leaders’ demands that would guarantee their constitutional right to hold peaceful protests.Duque met with the National Strike Committee after almost three weeks of protests and police repression that allegedly left more than 50 people dead, according to Human Rights Watch.The two parties will meet again on Monday to continue negotiating guarantees that would allow peaceful protests, according to the National Strike Committee.The strike leaders have stressed they needed the president to agree on this “one single point” to create the conditions that would allow negotiations on demands related to policy reforms.What the National Strike Committee called “one single point” in fact contains multiple demands, most notably the withdrawal of anti-riot police ESMAD and an end to the militarization of cities that was ordered on the first day of strikes on April 28.Additionally, the protesters want the president to order the creation of a special prosecution unit to investigate more than 2,000 human rights violations allegedly committed during the protests.Furthermore, the National Strike Committee demanded that Duque grants the request of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to independently investigate human rights abuses.Lastly, the protest leaders want Defense Minister Diego Molano to apologize for the excessive use of force applied in ongoing attempts to quell protests.Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos, who is negotiating on the president’s behalf, said he would study the demands and who would be responsible for meeting them.The organizations that are part of the Strike Committee have presented a document with two main parts: guarantees for the exercise of the protest and the second, guarantees for the negotiation tables. The negotiation table has not yet been installed, since this document must be analyzed.Peace Commissioner Miguel CeballosNational Strike Committee spokesperson Francisco Maltes said that that “we hope for a response by the government… as soon as possible.”Maltes reiterated the social organizations had called for a new national strike day for Wednesday as independent protests continue to take place throughout the country daily.The United Nations and the Catholic Church accompany the negotiations that are the first since the first National Strike Committee’s first strike day in November 2019 sparked the largest anti-government protests in more than four decades.The latest protests were initially smaller, but have grown to historic proportions in a widespread rejection of the security forces’ brutality. national strike ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-studying-demands-to-guarantee-peaceful-protests/,Colombia studying demands to guarantee peaceful protests
" President Ivan Duque called on the maximum deployment of Colombia’s security forces while his peace commissioner ignored strike leaders’ demands to end the violent repression of peaceful protests.In a televised address, Duque ordered the security forces’ maximum deployment claiming that “there is a clear criminal interest” behind roadblocks that have been put up in the southwest of the country.There exists no evidence of any involvement of criminal organizations or guerrilla groups in the protests.The president made the announcement while the organizers of national strikes were in a meeting with Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos who rejected demands to end police brutality.The National Strike Committee responded furiously to the deceit and claimed “Duque has declared war on the strike.”The strike organizers have nothing to do with the roadblocks or the majority of protests that erupted in response to a violent crackdown on protests in support of the April 28 strike.The government has tried to associate the strike organizers and peaceful protesters with acts of violence and vandalism that in some cases were carried out by police.Human Rights Watch is verifying reports that police additionally murdered more than 50 people in the most brutal attempt to quell the ongoing protests.Local human rights organization Temblores received more than 2,100 reports of police brutality, the NGO said Thursday.More than 440 of these reports related to police violently cracking down on peaceful protests and more than 1,000 related to the arbitrary detention of protesters.Reports of police terror continued and evidence of police involvement in armed attacks on peaceful protesters mounted on Monday.Opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda said that he had sent additional evidence of crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court to support criminal charges against Duque, Defense Minister Diego Molano and the commanders of the National Police and the National Army.

" Colombia’s anti-government protests have shown that the country’s youth no longer accept living in a country that has oppressed them for decades.The latest protests seem to be the final stages of a decades-long struggle between young people demanding opportunities and authorities demanding conformity.The origin of the protests that have President Ivan Duque against the wall can be traced back to 2011 when students successfully sunk former President Juan Manuel Santos’ education reform plans.Until that year, organizing student protests was almost impossible due to the fierce persecution of anything deemed “subversive” by now-defunct paramilitary group AUC and former President Alvaro Uribe, the informal boss of the current president.According to a recent student by the Gran Politecnica university, more than 10,000 were detained mainly on rebellion and terrorism charges between 2000 and early 2018.Only 491 of these students were found guilty as most arrested students were the victim of a systematic campaign to criminalize activism, particularly during when former President Alvaro Uribe was president between 2002 and 2010.The systematic criminalization of Colombia’s youth | 2000 – 2018The 2011 blowThe end of the Uribe administration and the dismantling of intelligence agency DAS ended much of the persecution, which allowed student protests to successfully sink a government policy proposal in 2011.Santos withdrew his education reform proposal that sought a partial privatization of Colombia’s public education system in November that year after more than six months of protests.The success allowed the students to play a major role in 2013 protests against an agricultural reform in which they supported a farmers’ uprising.The increasingly organized students remained a voice to be reckoned with, which was completely underestimated by President Ivan Duque after taking office in 2018.The students took to the streets almost immediately after the president took office and wanted to meddle with education budget and forced Duque to withdraw his proposal.Colombia’s students ignore Duque and maintain strike to demand education fundsThe prelude to the current protests(Image: Sergio Fernandez)Bogota students took to the streets again in September 2019 in protests against corruption, but were brutally repressed by the ESMAD after police infiltrators engaged in vandalism.In response, students across Colombia rose up to demand the dismantling of the loathed riot police unit on top of measures to curb corruption and government compliance with agreements that ended the 2018 protests.Teachers joined the students in October that year and indigenous groups, farmers and labor unions joined to call for a national strike in opposition to a tax reform in November 2019.First national strikeThe national strike triggered the largest anti-government protests in more than four decades despite attempts to criminalize the protests.The police escalated its violent crackdown, which only grew support for the protests led by the students exactly like before.This time, the violence tanked the approval rating of Duque and triggered a lawsuit that sought to restrict police brutality.Anti-government protest in Medellin (Image: Jorge Calle)The National Strike Committee that was formed to organize the protests called for a Christmas break in December and a resumption of protests in early 2020 to force the government to negotiate their demands.The coronavirus forced the strike leaders to suspend their protests, but in September received the support of the Supreme Court, which ordered the government to end the violent repression of protests.The latest roundDuque proposed another tax reform in April this year, which triggered the National Strike Committee to call for another strike.The April 28 strike wasn’t nearly as successful as the one in November 2019, but found an unexpected ally in the president and his new Defense Minister Diego Molano.The defense minister should have remembers how the violent crackdown of the September 2018 and November 2019 protests only made them bigger, but Molano apparently is an idiot.The defense minister called in both the National Police and the National Army to quell the protests even more brutally than before, triggering an even bigger backlash.While Molano was virtually begging the Supreme Court to throw him in prison, the protests swelled to proportions similar to those in 2019 and the government received international condemnation.As if the defense minister wasn’t in enough trouble with the Supreme Court already, the opposition filed criminal charges before the International Criminal Court.Within days, Congress withdrew its support for the tax reform and Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla resigned.After US lawmakers demanded the suspension of military aid to Colombia’s police, Foreign Minister Claudia Blum also resigned.Uribe dropped Duque like a disposable puppet, bringing the government on the brink of collapse.Ten years after their first political success, Colombia’s youth showed the country they can no longer be beaten into submission, but can seal presidents’ political death. national strikestudent protests ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-youth-breaking-free-from-decades-of-tyranny/,Colombia’s youth breaking free from decades of

" Fugitive former FARC ideologue “Jesus Santrich” was killed in Venezuela, Colombia’s defense minister and the dissident’s guerrilla group said Tuesday.Colombia’s defense ministry said that the virtually blind dissident died on Monday in a firefight with “other criminals,” which was contradicted by Santrich’s group, Nueva Marquetalia.”According to the guerrilla group of the FARC’s former political chief, “Ivan Marquez,” the top FARC dissident was killed in an operation by the Venezuelan military.One death, two conflicting political interestsDefense Minister Diego Molano said on Twitter that if his “intelligence” turned out to be correct, this “proves narco-criminals are hiding in Venezuela” in collusion with the government of authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro.The claim by the FARC dissidents implied that the Colombian government’s accusations made against Maduro are yet another conspiracy theory.“It’s going to be difficult to know with certainty who killed him,” according to BBC Mundo correspondent Daniel Pardo, who stressed the conflicting political interests of Bogota and Caracas, which didn’t immediately confirm the FARC dissident’s death.All versions are diffuse and all sources have interests to deny or confirm them. We may be left with the desire to know who killed Santrich.BBC correspondent Daniel PardoWhat is not disputedWhat is not disputed is that Santrich was killed on Monday in the Zulia state, close to where the FARC’s former ideologue abandoned the peace process he helped barter in 2019.Santrich’s death would be a major blow for Marquez, who lost one of his best friends and whose group is one of the main forces that seeks to reunite the FARC after the guerrillas’ demobilization in 2017.Molano’s claim that Colombian guerrilla groups are seeking refuge in Venezuela is also not being disputed as the military of the neighboring country has been combating FARC dissident groups for months.In fact, the ELN guerrilla group was active in both countries long before Maduro’s predecessor, late President Hugo Chavez, took office in 1999.The consequences for ColombiaSantrich’s death ends the possibility of tensions over a pending extradition request that was granted by Colombia’s Supreme Court last week.This extradition request was justified based on fabricated evidence that would support the testimony of a DEA informant who accused the FARC’s former ideologue of being involved in negotiating a drug deal.Santrich’s death is also a major blow for Marquez’s because the former FARC ideologue enjoyed great respect among demobilized and rearmed guerrillas.The trumped up US criminal charge surged anti-imperialist sentiments and the formation of more than two dozen FARC dissident groups by former FARC member who had lost faith in the peace process.Nueva Marquetalia’s attempts to unite these groups are being opposed by a rival group, the so-called Southeastern Bloc, which rejected the FARC’s 2016 peace deal with former President Juan Manuel Santos since before it was signed.Also this group, which is led by “Ivan Mordisco” and “Gentil Duarte,” is trying to incorporate this new wave of guerrilla groups.Perhaps most importantly, Santrich’s death is a major blow for his victims, who lost every opportunity for justice. armed conflictFARC dissidentsjesus santrichnewsletterNueva MarquetaliaVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/farc-dissident-jesus-santrich-killed-in-venezuela/,FARC dissident ‘Jesus Santrich’ killed in Venezuela

" Members of US Congress called on the government of President Joe Biden to suspend all aid to Colombia’s police, which is being accused of gross human rights violations to quell anti-government protests.In a letter, the 55 house representatives urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to reject the violence and suspend all direct aid to the National Police, with the exception of human rights training.Colombia’s security forces, especially its National Police, are more unleashed than we have seen in decades of strife – hundreds of citizen videos show aggressive, indiscriminate use of lethal and non-lethal weapons against citizens in ways that violate both Colombian law and international human rights standards.US lawmakersThe lawmakers explicitly urged Blinken to “ensure that the Colombian National Police Mobile Anti-Disturbances Squadron (ESMAD) riot police unit is not receiving grant assistance from the United States, directly or indirectly.”Student organizers who have been leading largely peaceful anti-government protests since April 28 want the dismantling of ESMAD.The loathed riot police unit “has a training and culture that lead to disturbingly aggressive and abusive actions against the civilian population, including demonstrators who do not pose any threat,” according to the US Congressmen.The result is many casualties—the ESMAD has carried out more than three-quarters of all killings attributed to security forces during the current protests—and unnecessary escalation of confrontations.US lawmakersThe lawmakers’ call to suspend aid came days after the US Ambassador to Bogota, Philip Goldberg, met with Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez to “resolve political differences” and discuss the “obligation to protect the right to the freedom to peaceful protests” of far-right President Ivan Duque’s government.US Congressmen previously warned that the ongoing police brutality could trigger the so-called Leahy Law, provisions that prohibit the US Government of sensing military aid to countries grossly violating human rights.Colombia is historically one of the largest recipients of US military aid.

" Colombia’s president Ivan Duque disappeared Wednesday after students avenged weeks of police brutality with massive street parties and his vice-president literally toppled herself.All Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez had to do was sit still while President Ivan Duque addressed a few dozen students who weren’t taking part in the peaceful uprising.Ironically, the VP somehow managed to fall out of her chair, all but ruining the president’s illusion that his government was still firmly in control of the country.Everybody but the few dozen people who saw Ramirez go down witnessed an unprecedented student uprising that made it evident that Duque had lost all control.Así se cae un gobierno sin que los protagonistas se den cuenta … pic.twitter.com/iQCHGyfaEq— Suárezterapia (@carlossuarezr) May 12, 2021The Duque illusionThe reality was that anti-government protesters had peacefully taken control of key points of all Colombia’s major cities.Duque had no idea as he was having a “meeting” with 36 university students, according to his website.After the alleged meeting, the president embarked on a 40-minute monologue to a virtually empty hall about some “Great Pact with the Youth of Colombia” he just made.I want to tell you: I will put all my energy, all my capacity and that of the whole Government team to make this process succeed. But I would like to invite you to take the lead in this exchange; that we create these spaces in the regions; that we show that this year, as a country, we are going to be able to vaccinate ourselves, to reactivate ourselves, to work for the most vulnerable and to empower this work with the youth.President Ivan DuqueColombia, according to President Duque. (Image: YouTube)Ramirez was on the floor less than a minute and a half after Duque had begun his speech.“Are you okay, vice?” asked the president before he continued about his “great pact.”Duque didn’t really seem to care about Ramirez, nobody did.Meanwhile in ColombiaWhile the VP was literally toppling herself and Duque was babbling to a virtually empty room, anti-protesters knocked down the government in retaliation two weeks of violent repression.With a wide variety of cultural performances, the students drew a larger and larger following until reaching key points in Colombia’s biggest cities for what could be the wildest block parties in recent history.Overwhelmed by the masses, the security forces seemed to have withdrawn. “I haven’t seen a single cop all day,” one onlooker who had been cheering the Medellin march told Colombia Reports.In the capital Bogota, students filled the central Bolivar Square and were having parties all over.Over 10,000 Colombians are occupying the Plaza de Bolivar in Bogotá, demanding justice for the dozens of protesters gunned down by the US-backed narco-regime of Ivan Duque and their paramilitary forces pic.twitter.com/yP37S6zoVB— Wyatt Reed (@wyattreed13) May 12, 2021Duque goes missingDuque disappeared from the public view after his VP toppled herself and the country’s youth all but toppled the government.Interior Minister Daniel Palacios was called to Congress to respond for the government’s failed attempts to violently quell the protests, killing more than 40 protesters while all but killing itself.Palacios refused to acknowledge the widespread human rights violations and much less accept the anti-government government had completely lost control over the country.I will never get tired of saying this, our police is professional, respectful, they are national heroes who put on the uniform to take care of all Colombians.Interior Minister Daniel PalaciosMinisters clueless about how to proceedDefense Minister Diego Molano was unable to come to Congress as he was too busy cleaning up the mess he had made.Farmers and indigenous peoples had been putting up roadblocks throughout the country while students were taking the cities.Defense Minister Diego Molano speaking to Congress in between screwing up.

" Colombia’s security forces apparently entered panic mode and the government of President Ivan Duque all but collapsed after the US Congress reiterated threats to cut military funds.The panic was most evident on the National Army’s twitter page, which suddenly began publishing in Spanglish about mysterious “spirit of body and military training.”The prosecution and the police additionally announced investigations into reports on widespread human rights violations against anti-government protesters.This violence that surged after protests began on April 28 suddenly stopped on Wednesday when police apparently retreated from the streets in the major cities.Colombia’s anti-government protests | Part 3: the VP topples herselfThe Leahy LawThe army panic and the investigations followed fierce criticism by US Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat who is the second highest ranking Senator and president of the Appropriations Committee, which has a major say in foreign spending.The Senator is also the author of two statutory provisions called “The Leahy Law” that bar the US Government from providing military aid on countries that grossly violate human rights.Leahy blasted Duque’s response to the protests and the State Department updated its fact sheet on the Leahy Law on Tuesday.The US has invested billions to help Colombia prosper and establish a foundation for the rule of law.

" The suicide of a 17-year-old girl who accused police of sexual abuse sparked an uprising in southwest Colombia that left at least one person dead, 35 injured and the local police jail destroyed.The news of the suicide of the ICT student dropped a bomb on Colombia and turned anti-government protests into a violent uprising in the city of Popayan on Friday.On her Instagram account, the girl had decried how she had been sexually harassed after being detained by members of the loathed riot police unit ESMAD on Wednesday.The commander of the police in southwest Colombia, General Ricardo Alarcon, told media that the dead girl’s claims were “fake news” despite evidence indicating the opposite.Nevertheless, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa announced a criminal investigation into the sexual abuse claims of the student who had committed suicide.Aquí queda registrado cuando se llevan a Allison  Melendez.No permitamos que se los lleven, un mensaje para todos los que estamos en las marchas, NO DEJEMOS QUE LA POLICÍA Y EL ESMAD SE LOS LLEVEN POR FAVOR. pic.twitter.com/IohjsyoVcn— Laura Martínez (@LauraMMoficial) May 14, 2021The dead girl’s last word, the hashtag “#UribeParacoHPTA,” went trending in all of Colombia.

" President Ivan Duque has left Colombia’s ambassadors without boss since the resignation of his foreign minister on Thursday.Foreign Minister Claudia Blum confirmed on Thursday that she had resigned after unconfirmed reports over tensions between her and the embattled president.Blum’s departure couldn’t be less convenient as she vacated her post amid growing international criticism over Duque’s increasingly tyrannical government.It has been an honor to be Colombia’s Foreign Minister during this time. And I am sure that with the leadership of President Iván Duque, the country will continue on the path of sustainable development, the social and economic recovery from the effects of the pandemic, and the consolidation of the consensus that ratifies the unity and strength of our Nation.Former Foreign Minister Claudia BlumThe president has yet to confirm the resignation of his foreign minister, who apparently left her deputy Adriana Mejia provisionally in charge.Duque failed to appoint Mejia as acting foreign minister though, which left the government’s ambassadors abroad without a boss.Colombia’s ambassador to Washington DC, Francisco Santos, said Friday that US President Joe Biden “should maintain sanctions and squeeze the mafiosi who are destroying Venezuela even more.”The ambassador and the Foreign Ministry remained quiet, however, after 55 congressmen called on US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to suspend military aid to Colombia’s police.US lawmakers want to suspend aid to Colombia’s policeDuque, his defense minister and the security forces have come under growing international criticism about the National Police’s use of deadly force to quell largely peaceful anti-government protests.Colombia’s ambassador to the Organization of American States, Alejandro Ordoñez, informed Secretary General Luis Almargo about the human rights situation in Colombia.The usually outspoken ambassador has refrained from making any public statements about the situation since Blum resigned as none of the deputy foreign ministers or ambassadors have been authorized to publicly address the growing international concerns.

" Colombia’s defense minister destroyed whatever was left of President Ivan Duque’s credibility as a terrorism campaign against anti-government protesters who were promised talks continued.Duque’s alleged concession to talk personally to the National Strike Committee could have been a first step to end an escalation of protests had it not been for his Defense Minister Diego Molano.The defense minister continued a terrorism campaign against participants of anti-government protests after other top officials announced Duque was willing to talk.The violence killed at least 36 people since a national strike on Wednesday last week, according to Human Rights Watch. Almost 380 people have disappeared, the Missing Persons Search Unit said Thursday.Almost 380 of Colombia’s anti-government protesters ‘disappeared’ in past weekDuque’s alleged willingness to talkThe president refused any personal encounters with the strike leaders after their first national strike in 2019 sparked the largest anti-government protests in more than four decades.Labor Minister Angel Custodio told government-loyal newspaper El Tiempo that the talks would begin on Monday, but this was not confirmed by the social leaders.Peace commissioner Miguel Ceballos claimed “the government has demanded non-violence and that the actions of public officials, including the security forces, are within the framework of human rights,” contrary to abundant evidence proving the exact opposite.Duque’s doublespeak, Ceballos’ lies and Molano’s apparent refusal not to commit crimes against humanity destroyed the credibility of Custodio’s claims and made significant talks unlikely while violence continued.La luna cali pic.twitter.com/Yl3Wm7qW7E— dahianna beltran (@dahia_22bel) May 7, 2021Strike leaders not interested in small talkLabor union leader Francisco Maltes told weekly Semana that the National Strike Commission were not interested in socializing with Duque, but wanted the president to commit to negotiating their specific demands.Talks with Molano went nowhere when he was the president’s chief of staff in 2019 because the current defense minister refused to negotiate.At the time, Duque embarked on a “national dialogue” with all kinds of social organizations, which led to little more than a photo photo ops in which the president pretended to govern.The coronavirus aggravated the situation in Colombia on top of the president’s characteristic misrule.Notwithstanding, also this time none of the government officials mentioned the word “negotiations” and again seemed to effectively evade talks while perpetuating violenceEsta madrugada en Cali sector siloe pic.twitter.com/7YaKXOVa2T— simon Bolívar (@ChechoB1223) May 7, 2021The learning disabilitiesNeither Duque nor Molano appeared to have learned a single thing since 2019 or have the slightest idea what they are doing.While Maltes and Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos were seeking the press to claim Duque agreed to talk, the president and his defense minister continued what they do best, sinking Colombia into chaos.Only hours after Duque held a speech in which the president called to “reject all acts of violence” police in Cali continued Molano’s terrorism campaign that ignited even bigger and also violent protests.The National Strike Committee said earlier this week it was not again going to take part in the president’s deceit and on Thursday demanded and end to nonsense and violence.We demand that the government of President Duque put an immediate end to the repression, proceed to demilitarize the cities, dismantle the ESMAD, punish those responsible for the brutal repression of citizen protest, offer guarantees for the right to social protest and undertake the negotiation of the single emergency plan of action with the National Strike Committee.National Strike CommitteeAs the government turned to the country’s mass media to deceive the public as it did in 2019, Colombia sunk deeper into chaos without any indication the government was genuinely considering a solution. national strikenewsletterpolice brutalitystate terrorism ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-continues-to-terrorize-population-after-promising-talks-to-end-protests/,Colombia continues to terrorize population after promising talks to end protests

" Colombia’s mass media and the Cali Police Department tried to cover up an attempted massacre of native Colombians by far-right supporters of President Ivan Duque.At least eight indigenous protesters were injured on Sunday when heavily armed supporters of the increasingly authoritarian president indiscriminately opened fire on the buses they were driving.The armed residents from an upscale neighborhood in the south of Cali received help from at least one policeman while preparing the massacre, according to video footage.White supremacy in Colombia | Part 1: Kill the Indians!In order to cover up the attempted massacre, Cali Police chief Juan Carlos Rodriguez falsely accused the victims of incinerating two vehicle and falsely claimed that some were carrying firearms.La FM director journalist Luis Carlos Velez subsequently reported that locals blamed native Colombians for breaking into their housing complex and vandalized vehicles.The false claims were repeated by RCN Television, a sister company of LA FM that is also owned by controversial business mogul Carlos Ardila Lulle, who illegally occupies land from the indigenous.The same false claims were repeated on Caracol Television, which went as far negating that the indigenous were Colombian citizens.The extensive media coverage based on the alleged criminal conspiracy between the Cali extremists and the local police department provided the pretext for President Ivan Duque to order a brutal terrorism campaign.Duque orders more troops to Colombia’s southwest amid fears of civil warThis terrorism campaign was promoted by a local death squad, “the Anti-Communist Brigade,” which said on Twitter it would take part in the terror campaign and previously claimed to be working with the Cali Police Department .The latest terror campaign of Duque, Defense Minister Diego Molano, Rodriguez and the Anti-Communist Brigade was discovered after which an international commission immediately flew to Cali to prevent further harm being done by the government, its extremist allies and the Cali police chief.Colombia state terror campaign broadcast live on TwitterThe Cali Police Department was already facing accusations of permitting another terror campaign that justified the defense minister to militarize the the city in late April after which local police embarked on the mass killing of citizens.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, one of Duque’s best friends, has refused to investigate both terror campaigns that have severely traumatized the city without breaking its opposition to the tyrannical president.

" The government of Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque said Tuesday that it is willing to negotiate an end to anti-government protests that continue Wednesday.In a video message, Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos said the government accepted to negotiate demands of the National Strike Committee to end the protests that began on April 28.The National Government, from this moment on, is fully willing to advance a negotiation table with the National Strike Committee, in order to advance in the topics of the agenda that we will agree with the accompaniment of the Catholic Church and the United Nations.Peace Commissioner Miguel CeballosThe statement of Ceballos implies a major concession of the Duque administration, which has categorically rejected negotiations since November 2019 when the first strike triggered the country’s largest anti-government protests in more than four decades.Fabio Arias of labor union CUT, one of the members of the National Strike Committee, welcomes Ceballos’ words as “very positive,” but added that the government has yet to formally inform the social organizations.This is a very positive thing, but formally we have not been informed about what that table will look like. I only know that this morning they published a video.Labor union leader Fabio AriasThe April 28 strike and subsequent attempts to violently repress protests organized by the National Strike Committee triggered protests throughout Colombia that enter their third week on Wednesday.The violence has killed more than 40 protesters and one policeman, according to the government’s human rights office.The Search Unit for Missing Persons, a body formed as part of Colombia’s ongoing peace process, said last week that it had received reports that almost 400 people had gone missing during the protests.The Prosecutor General’s Office contradicted this on Monday, claiming that that “as of today there exist no formal reports of disappearances related to the protests.”The office of chief prosecutor Fransisco Barbosa, one of Duque’s best friends, said that 227 people who had been reported missing with the Ombudsman’s Office, had all been located.Barbosa and Ombudsman Carlos Camargo have been under heavy fire over their failure to respond to reports of widespread police brutality and the alleged mass disappearance of protesters.Foreign governments and human rights organizations have expressed their concern of the security forces’ brutal response to the protests that began largely peaceful.Whether Ceballos’ commitment to negotiate is sincere remains to be seen.

" Colombia’s controversial finance minister will resign after mass protests forced President Ivan Duque to withdraw the government’s latest reform proposal, according to local media.According to Blu Radio, which is run by President Ivan Duque’s brother-in-law, Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla plans to hand in his resignation for the second time on Monday.The minister offered his resignation for the first time last year already, but stayed in office after the Central Bank voted against his ambitions to become president.This time, Colombia’s most loathed politicians reportedly will leave office after President Ivan Duque promised to withdraw Carrasquilla’s tax reform proposal that sparked deadly protests.The finance minister’s proposed tax reform was already dead in the water as no political party would support his Carraquilla’s third tax reform proposal.The finance minister is one of the most loyal allies of Duque and the president’s unofficial boss, former President Alvaro Uribe, who made Carrasquilla finance minister in 2003.The economist is also one of Colombia’s most loathed politicians because of his ineptitude, corruption and tax reforms seeking to enrich the country’s elite at the expense of the general population.Carrasquilla used his position as Uribe’s finance minister to legalize a criminal racket that all but bankrupted almost 10% of the country’s municipalities, but enriched himself.As finance minister of Duque proposed to grant tax discounts to corporations against the almost unanimous advice of Colombia’s economists, which triggered the country’s largest ant-government protests in 2019.Carrasquilla’s latest tax reform proposal was proposed to Congress in early April and rejected by all political parties but Uribe’s far-right Democratic Center party.The government’s attempts to have the reform approved through congressional backdoors triggered last week’s protests that left 21 people dead, and an unknown number of offices of banks and corporations destroyed.Government critics celebrated the finance minister’s reported renunciation, but said they were vigilant Carrasquilla wasn’t  involved in another governmental get-rich-quick scheme.

" Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe, a.k.a. “The Slaughterman,” is recycling his former Medellin Cartel allies’ strategy to prevent prosecution on drug-related charges with terrorism.The former president grew up with the Ochoa crime family, which founded Colombia’s most notorious cartel with the cousin of Uribe’s former presidential adviser, Pablo Escobar.The former presidents late brother Jaime had two children with Dolly Cifuentes, whose family initially initially trafficked cocaine for the Medellin Cartel and later “El Chapo” of Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel.Santiago Uribe (R) and convicted Medellin Cartel founder Fabio Ochoa (L)Old-school narcoterrorismThe former president has been able to evade justice since the first evidence emerged of the Uribe family’s ties to the cartel in 1984, but is currently being investigated for three massacres, a homicide, a narco conspiracy to rig the 2018 elections and witness tampering.The term “narcoterrorism” was initially coined in 1984 to describe the terrorism actively of Escobar and his associated to protect their mafia interests.One of the most iconic of these acts of terrorism was the 1989 bombing of an airplane that had been made possible with support of the military and British mercenaries.The term “narcoterrorism” got a different connotation after the death of Escobar in 1993 and it was used to describe rebel groups like the FARC and ELN.Paramilitary groups that had inherited many of the cartel’s drug trafficking routes and were involved in terrorism even more were given the euphemistic name “self-defense groups.”Their organization, the AUC, were determined a foreign terrorist organization by the US government in September 2001 after which they helped Uribe become president in 2002.Uribe meeting with paramilitaries in October 2001 after they had become a designated terrorist group.21st-century narcoterrorismInvestigations into the Metro Bloc in 2011 revealed evidence indicating that “The Slaughterman” and his brother Santiago formed this paramilitary group with former cartel associates after Escobar’s death in the 1990s.While Uribe continued referring to the guerrillas as narcoterrorists, legal trouble of the narcoterrorism activity of the former president, and his allies in the security forces grew, especially after a 2016 peace deal with the FARC.With the help of the mafia, “The Slaughterman” was able to secure the 2018 election of his puppet, President Ivan Duque, who was able to maintain Uribe’s alleged ties to the cartel and the paramilitaries’ terrorism and drug trafficking activities under the rug.This began falling apart in November 2019 when Duque’s misrule led to a major defeat of Uribe’s far-right “Democratic Center” party in local elections and a national strike that led to the biggest anti-government demonstrations since the 1970’s.The former commander of the National Police, General Oscar Atehortua, sought to quell these protests in Cali and Bogota with the use of terrorism tactics, but failed.Colombia’s state forces apparently involved in ‘orchestrated terror’ campaignThe consolidation of the mafia governmentEvidence of mafia support for Duque’s election and the alleged complicity of the commander of the National Army, General Enrique Zapateiro, in two homicides got Uribe and his puppet and the army commander in even more trouble.The Supreme Court began investigating Uribe for his allegedly leading ole in the 2018 narco-conspiracy while the prosecution began investigating the Uribistas’ far-right party.Zapateira’s alleged involvement in the two murders made him a suspect in an investigations carried out by war crimes tribunal JEP, which was already investigating other Uribe former allies in the military with mafia ties.The government lost almost all legitimacy when the former president was forced to leave the senate in August last year after the Supreme Court placed him under house arrest over “The Slaughterman’s” alleged witness tampering practices.The government embarked on its second terrorism campaign to quell protests in Bogota in September under the leadership of late Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo.Trujillo’s successor, current Defense Minister Diego Molano, Armed Forces commander General Luis Navarro and current Interior Minister Daniel Palacios also oversaw the massacre of at least 13 people in the capital.President Ivan Duque’s former Chief of Staff and current Defense Minister Diego Molano, late Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, acting National Police Chief Gustavo Moreno and Armed Forces commander Luis NavarroBy then, the Uribistas felt they were so above the law they didn’t even bother deleting evidence indicating they were complicit in a massacre from the internet.Colombia’s defense minister leaves evidence of orchestrating terrorism onlinePlan Z: A dictatorshipEvidence of the Uribistas’ ties to the Sinaloa Cartel mounted until almost the only ones denying Colombia had fallen under the control of a mafia government were the alleged mafiosi in government themselves.Duque’s misrule and the increasingly compelling evidence of the mafia activities of “The Slaughterman” and top military commanders was a ticking time bomb though, as sooner or later the alleged mafioso would have to go to court unless they used terrorism to abandon the rule of law and turn Colombia into a mafia state.Uribe and his puppet named Duque’s former chief of staff, Diego Molano, defense minister in February.Molano possibly doesn’t even know there is a difference between government and organized crime, he’s a business administrator and too young to remember the Medellin Cartel’s narcoterrorism.The defense minister should know that he probably would still be unemployed had it not been for “The Slaughterman.”When the National Strike Committee called for a national strike in early April, Zapateira knew that the defense minister had bungled the management of protests to the point Duque almost fell.The National Army began an illegal spying operation targeting the strike organizers, according to leaked intelligence documents, and Molano militarized Cali on Wednesday last week.What followed was another terrorism campaign and another police massacre in which at lest 10 people were assassinated, including the cousin of Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina.Diego Molano coordinating the Cali Massacre (Image: Defense Ministry)Had the defense minister known these crimes could put him away for decades he probably wouldn’t have published evidence of his involvement on social media, but he did.Duque said he was aware that he was Colombia’s army-in-chief, implying that he knew that by Sunday he was responsible for four terrorism campaigns and two massacres, which could put the president away for life.The only way to prevent prison was to instill a dictatorship with the help of the military and the support of his mafia boss, which Duque tried on Monday.The military and the police, this time under the command of General Jorge Luis Vargas, embarked on the most brutal terrorism operation to prevent prosecution on drug-related charges in years.How many people were killed was still uncertain on Tuesday morning, but not the minions of “The Slaughterman” who are responsible.Colombia begs for help as Duque embarks on indescribable terror

" Colombia’s defense minister gave police a “standing ovation” for the allegedly “criminal actions against the population” that killed at least 30 anti-government protesters in a week.Defense Minister Diego Molano’s praise for the alleged police was arguably his most insane comment since taking office in February and sinking the country in an indescribable crisis.Colombia begs for help as Duque embarks on indescribable terror campaignThe United Nations’ human rights office released a blistering statement in which they expressed “our profound shock” after “police opened fire on demonstrators protesting against tax reforms, reportedly killing and injuring a number of people.” on Monday.Our office in Colombia is working to verify the exact number of casualties, and establish how this terrible incident came about in Cali. Human rights defenders are also reporting they have been harassed and threatened.United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human RightsAccording to conservative estimates published by government-loyal television network RCN, police murdered five people in their attempt to quell the protests in Cali’s Siloe neighborhood alone.Molano wouldn’t let citizens or the UN piss on his bonfire of terror and expressed his “admiration and gratitude” for the police, specifically in Colombia’s third largest city.Monday’s massacre was the second in Colombia’s third largest city since the defense minister ordered to militarize Cali on the first day of national protest against far-right President Ivan Duque on Wednesday last week.Human Rights Watch Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco said on Wednesday that his office had confirmed the killing of 11 people, of whom seven were murdered in Cali, before Monday’s massacre.Protests in Colombia turn deadly: police massacres ‘at least 8’ in CaliThe human right organization was in the process of verifying another 20 people who were killed in the anti-government protests.Local human rights organization Temblores said Wednesday that 37 people were killed and another 110 were injured after police opened fire on civilians throughout Colombia after meeting with UN officials.In the alternative reality of the defense minister, however, the police were “risking their lives to protect all Colombians.”Colombia fighting violent repression of anti-government protestsWhether Molano has gone completely insane or is desperately trying to keep his job and evade prison is uncertain.A collective of 16 senators filed a motion of no confidence against the minister on Tuesday, claiming that Molano has made it “evident that he has been leading the operations that have resulted in hundreds of injured and killed people in the context of social and peaceful protests, not only in the city of Cali.”While coordinating a terror campaign against civilians, the minister claimed on Twitter that police had gone on a rampage against civilians as part of  his effort to confront “the terrorist threat of criminal groups.”Molano will have to appear before Congress on Thursday, which may shed some clarity on why the minister is behaving like a genocidal maniac.

" President Ivan Duque was humiliated on Saturday when Colombia’s mayors rejected his idea to militarize cities to quell anti-government protests.In a television address, Duque seemed determines to fulfil his “obligation as President of the Republic” and use the army to “first and foremost guarantee the security of citizens above all else.”(Image: President’s Office)The militarization attemptThe far-right president vowed “to guarantee the right to protest” as part of an ongoing national strike that kicked off on Wednesday to force the withdrawal of a widely rejected tax reform.However, I would also like to issue a clear warning to those who by means of violence, vandalism and terrorism, seek to intimidate society and believe that through this mechanism they can subdue the institutions. We will not allow people taking the law in their own hands, the destruction of public and private property or the message of hatred to have a place in our country.President Ivan DuqueIronically, Duque’s rejection of hate speech came after Twitter censored his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe for “glorifying violence” and the opposition announced criminal charges against the former Medellin Cartel associate for allegedly inciting violence.The president’s rejection of violence and vandalism followed a terror campaign overseen by Defense Minister Diego Molano that killed at least 10 people in Cali.Protests in Colombia turn deadly: police massacres ‘at least 8’ in CaliMolano’s disaster did not break the resilience of Colombia’s third largest city, who continued protesting to demand the withdrawal of the tac reform on Saturday.Uribe’s ongoing stigmatization of opposition to the puppet president fueled protests in other cities.(Image: Johan Obando)Duque’s hurt feelingsThe far-right president apparently confused opposition to his increasingly authoritarian government with “violence, vandalism and terrorism” he could solve by militarizing the cities.As Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the military assistance model will remain in force in urban centers where there is a high risk to the integrity of citizens and where the full capacity of the State is required to protect the population.President Ivan DuqueUnfortunately for Duque, the military’s duty is to protect the country against potential national security threats and can only assist local police departments if mayors request help to maintain public order.People opposing the president’s policies is the problem of Duque and Duque alone.Saturday’s protest in Bogota (Image: Jaime Andres Wilches)Mayors say ‘no thanks’The progressive mayors of Colombia’s largest cities made it clear they couldn’t care less about the president’s ego.The mayor of the capital Bogota, Claudia Lopez, dismissed the president almost immediately, claiming “we don’t need nor have we requested any militarization” to deal with the anti-government protests.Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero stressed that he also “will not request additional military assistance with the current protests” in Colombia’s second largest city.Caí Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina rubbed it in particularly harsh and told Duque “not to cause more deaths here” as his city recovers from Molano’s bloodbath.Mr. President, the tax reform is dead.

" Twitter deleted a tweet of Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe, claiming the far-right politician was “glorifying violence” during anti-government protests.The intervention of the social media platform followed mass indignation over a tweet in which Uribe called to support the use of deadly force against protesters.The tweet of the former Medellin Cartel associate followed the assassination of a teenager by a policemen in Cali where human rights organizations fear security forces massacred 14 people since Wednesday.Let’s support the right of soldiers and police to use their firearms to defend their integrity and to defend people and property from criminal acts of terrorist vandalism.Former President Alvaro UribeUribe has published a flurry of tweets in which he inflated incidents of vandalism and implied that people participating in a national strike and anti-government protests were responsible for violence.The Americas director of Human Rights Watch, Miguel Vivanco, tweeted that “someone needs to explain Uribe” that “according to international standards, the police can only use firearms as a last resort to stop a certain threat to life.”Opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda said he would file criminal charges against the far-right politician who resigned from the Senate last year to evade a Supreme Court investigation into his alleged criminal activity.The misrepresentation of violenceThe marches that were organized as part of the national strike were largely peaceful and much of the reported violence seemed part of a campaign to criminalize the protesters.The allegedly criminal former president was banned from Twitter for two weeks in 2019 when he published the names of organizers of protests against his puppet, President Ivan Duque.Like in 2019, attempts to criminalize government critics has fueled anti-government protests that have continued unabated throughout Colombia since Wednesday.The perfect excuse of police brutalityUribe’s false claims provided Duque’s defense minister, Diego Molano, with the justification to brutally crack down on protests, which has left an unknown number of people dead and many dozens injured.The national strike was initially called as a protest against a tax reform proposed by Finance Minister and alleged fraudster Alberto Carrasquilla in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Carrasquilla’s previous tax reform fueled the 2019 anti-government protests that turned out to be the largest in Colombia in more than four decades.The current police violence could mean trouble for Duque and Molano who were ordered by the Supreme Court to refrain from violently repressing Colombians’ constitutional right to protest peacefully.

The healthcare systems in other major cities collapsed weeks ago already.The situation is most critical in Medellin where only 18 of the city’s 1053 ICU’s are available, according to statistics by the Health Secretary of the Antioquia province.Hundreds of people are waiting to be transferred to one of the ICU’s of Colombia’s second largest city amid fears that a growing number of medium-care patients could deplete region oxygen supplies.Bogota’s mass transit system full as hospitals on brink of collapseHumanitarian disasterThe government of President Ivan Duque has refused to listen to medical organizations that have begged for a minimum basic income and a new lockdown to resuscitate collapsed healthcare systems and prevent the collapse of healthcare in cities like Bogota.Duque and Health Minister Fernando Ruiz are under severe pressure from powerful business associations and corporations to ignore public health and the national economy.Ruiz has only allowed governors and mayors to impose mobility restrictions at night and during the weekend, which forces many urban dwellers to commute in overcrowded mass transit systems.The government’s refusal to implement a minimum basic income as advised by both the medical community turned the  healthcare crisis into a humanitarian disaster for the country’s poor and lower class communities.Almost two-thirds of the more than 73,000 coronavirus-related deaths were mourned in these communities while only 3.4% of the fatalities were mourned by the families of the country’s top earners.The country’s poverty rate increased to between 40%, according to the most optimistic estimate, and 49%, according to the most pessimistic estimate.The government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has contributed to social unrest and the resurgence of anti-government protests.Coronavirus crisis bankrupted 500K of Colombia’s small businessesA chaotic vaccination planThe failure to control the latest coronavirus outbreak is partly due to the chaotic implementation of the government’s National Vaccination Plan.Duque and Ruiz have repeatedly vowed they would protect 70% of Colombia’s 51 million inhabitants against the coronavirus before the end of the year.Since the unprecedented vaccination drive kicked off on February 17, health authorities have only been able to vaccinate 1.5 million people.This implies that those who fall in the government’s lowest priority group would have to wait until August 2023 for their vaccination.National Vaccination PlanThe main problem is that foreign pharmaceutical companies fail to produce and deliver vaccines as promised, an issue that is causing problems worldwide.In April, less than half of the 8.5 million vaccine shots promised by Ruiz last month effectively arrived on Bogota’s El Dorado Airport.These delays and problems with distribution have caused vaccine shortages throughout Colombia that in turn have forced local authorities to pause planned vaccinations.Another problem is that many of the notoriously corrupt health intermediaries never updated their databases, which has particularly complicated effectively vaccinated people of 80 and older who were designated the vaccination plan’s top priority.To counter the delays caused by the intermediaries, the health minister on Thursday announced that he would lower the age of people who can be vaccinated to 60.The minister already allowed people of 65 and older to request vaccination at public hospitals without the involvement of the controversial health intermediaries.More 2.8 million Colombians have been infected by the coronavirus since it was first detected in March last year, according to the Health Ministry. coronavirusnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-surpasses-500-daily-covid-19-deaths-after-pandemics-most-fatal-week/,Colombia surpasses 500 daily COVID-19 deaths after pandemic’s most fatal week
" Residents of Bogota and Medellin continued to report brutal police repression of anti-government protests while Colombia’s third largest city Cali retook the streets on Saturday.The massive turnout followed days of terror that left 10 people dead since Wednesday, the first day of a national strike against a tax reform proposed by the government of President Ivan Duque.The terrorizing of the local population diminished drastically after local human rights organizations accused Defense Minister Diego Molano of playing a key role in the alleged state terror campaign on Friday.Indigenous authorities from the nearby Cauca department sent indigenous to the city to provide protection against the Cali Police Department, the local mafia, and the security forces sent from Bogota.(Image: El Parche Critico)Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina, who was apparently taken by surprise by the alleged state terrorism campaign, encouraged locals to take part in the anti-government protests.Ospina retreated from the public eye after initially expressing suspicion about the “premeditated” terror campaign of unidentified groups that acted with the permission of the local police, according to a local.Las grandes mayorias se movilizan en paz, y dicen no al saqueo.

" The coronavirus is disproportionately killing Colombia’s poor, who make up more than 60% of the fatalities registered by the country’s statistics agency DANE.In a report, DANE said that 64.4% of the 70,848 deaths analyzed by the statistics agency were categorized as people from the lowest three social stratifications.According to 2018 estimates, 49% of Colombia’s population belongs to these stratifications, indicating how poor and lower-class Colombians were disproportionately victimized by the pandemic.Another 32.3% of the deaths were people from the middle class, a group that makes up an estimated 35% of the national population.The 16% of people designated as upper class contributed only 3.4% of the coronavirus-related deaths registered until April 11.The statistics agency was unable to determine the social class of 2.9% of analyzed COVID-19 fatalities.COVID-19 deaths per social classThe DANE study only studied fatalities caused by COVID-19 and did not include the social impact of the coronavirus and the economic crisis it caused.A previous study by DANE showed that the crisis surged unemployment and underemployment while other studies showed that the country’s poverty rate skyrocketed throughout 2020.Colombia tries to recover loss of formal jobs with informal laborRegional differencesThe study also revealed how the pandemic generated a much higher mortality rate in the Andean region while killing less people per 100,000 inhabitants in the tropical Caribbean region.The virus additionally seemed to have more difficulty spreading in remote and underdeveloped areas where locals’ mobility is limited.The exception to this apparent rule was the southern Amazonas province, which was hit by a an almost uncontrollable wave at the beginning of the pandemic when health authorities were still being equipped.Colombia’s healthcare show: ‘If you get seriously ill, you die’The reliability of this fatality rate is limited as health authorities’ testing capacity in remote regions was severely limited by complications in mobility.COVID-19 mortality rate per province  coronavirusnewsletterpoverty ",https://colombiareports.com/how-covid-19-disproportionately-killed-colombias-poor/,COVID-19 disproportionately killed Colombia’s poor

" Colombia is preparing for a national strike on Wednesday as tensions over President Ivan Duque’s misrule have been building and elections are approaching.The national strike could be the first major challenge to the government since November 2019 when hundreds of thousands of people took part in the largest anti-government protests in more than four decades.Like in 2019, a new tax reform spurred labor unions, student organizations and ethnic minorities to call for a national strike against the increasingly authoritarian government.Apart from the social organizations, fan clubs of some of Colombia’s largest football clubs said they supported the strike that was violently repressed by the government in 2019.The latest to announced to lay down work was teachers’ union Fecode, which has been at odds with the national government since Duque took office in 2018.Colombia’s failing state | Part 3: the generation with no futureMass protests amid a pandemicThe latest protests are taking part more than a year after the coronavirus caused Colombia’s biggest economic crash in recorded history, which caused unemployment and poverty rates not seen in years.Healthcare organizations have expressed their support for the national strike, but stressed not to embark on massive marches like in 2019, but to decentralize protests to avoid mass agglomerations amid the worst public health crisis in a century.Following the violent repression of the 2019 protests, many expressed their discontent with the government banging pots and pans from home.The call for that day is for a national strike and protest; and there are many ways to protest.Epidemiologist and social activist Victor de CurrealugoApproaching electionsThe national strike is planned less than a year before congressional elections in an apparent attempt to send a signal to Congress that ignoring the protests may end lawmakers’ political career in March next year.Duque’s initial tax reform in 2018 sunk the president’s approval rating less than three months after taking office.The 2019 attempt to revive this tax reform after it was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court was one of the main reasons for social organizations to organize the mass protests.Critics blame Duque and his controversial Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla of reducing the middle class acquisition power and benefiting the rich, which would slow down the country’s economic recovery from the worst crisis in recorded history, according to economists. national strike ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-prepares-for-new-national-strike/,Colombia prepares for new national strike

During the Duque administration more than 190 indigenous leaders were assassinated.Wayuu indigenous leader Martha PeraltaIndigenous protest in the western Choco province (Image: ONIC)Violence in Bogota, Medellin and CaliThe biggest protest was held in Bogota where anti-government protesters had gathered at 53 points to march to the Simon Bolivar Square, the political heart of Colombia.The protests in Bogota were tense and marred by violent incidents since early in the morning when people tried to shut down the capital’s mass transit system and clashed with police.Riots not affiliated with the protests broke out in the western Suba district.The main protest turned violent a little before 3PM after police refused the protesters to enter the central square, the final destination of the marches.Violence also broke out between police and civilians in Medellin, Colombia’s second largest city.Whilst some of the violence was caused by rioters, a foreign investor and local resident told Colombia Reports that he was filming police violence against a young female student who was protesting peacefully.According to witnesses and video footage, Police started yelling “bandit” as they were upset he was filming their unwarranted violence.  Neighbours prevented further police violence against the bystander after shouting that he was a neighbour and not involved.Mayor Daniel Quintero imposed a curfew in the downtown area after clashed between police and rioters.Defense Minister Diego Molano militarized Cali after a series of violent incidents.Majority of protests peacefulIt is what it is.#ParoNacional28A #NoALaReformaTributaria pic.twitter.com/ve2E4pHsWa— gabriela (@Gabriela21diaz) April 28, 2021Despite efforts of the government to portray the anti-government protests as violent, the majority of them were peaceful and the violence that did occur was incidental.The cacerolazos that followed the violent crackdowns indicated the national strike was broadly supported unlike President Ivan Duque, who can’t seem to receive public approval despite extensive campaigns to improve his image.Duque, who tried to impede the protests, said in the afternoon that he would not withdraw the tax reform that triggered the national strike.The president’s refusal increases the chances that the strike, which was originally planned for one day, becomes indefinite.The chances of the tax reform making it through congress are slim as the majority of political parties have withdrawn their support from the government bill. militarynational strikesocial protests ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-anti-government-protests-revive-despite-police-crackdown/,Colombia’s anti-government protests revive despite police crackdown
" A Bogota court ordered Colombia’s President Ivan Duque to announce the suspension of the right to “pubic” protest on Tuesday, a day before a national strike was planned.The far-right president asked the Bogota Administrative Tribunal to suspend permissions of anti-government protests on Wednesday and Labor Day celebrations on May 1.The Bogota court granted the request and ordered the president to announce the suspension of “pubic manifestations.”Other parts of the ruling made it clear that Judge Valentina Arboleda meant “public manifestation” and accidentally referred to the lower part of the pelvis while suspending Colombians’ constitutional right to “demonstrate publicly and peacefully.”Any group of individuals may gather and demonstrate publicly and peacefully. Only the law may specify those instances in which the exercise of this right may be limited.Article 37 of Colombia’s ConstitutionThe National Strike Committee, which called the national strike and was organizing the protests “for life, peace, democracy and against the tax reform” of the government said they would ignore the court order.According to the strike organizers, “the National Strike Committee and the organizations that are part of it were not implicated” in the ruling.Consequently, “we will maintain the call for a national strike,” the National Strike Committee said in a statement.The strike organizers released strict biosafety protocols on Monday that will be in force during the protests that take place amid the deadliest wave of coronavirus infections since the beginning of the pandemic.The most recent outbreak is largely due to the government’s negligence in enforcing any biosafety measures that may slow down the recovery from the pandemic that caused the worst economic crash in Colombia’s recorded history.Opposition forces have explicitly supported the national strike’s demand to withdraw the tax reform, but have been hesitant to support public protests.The opposition’s leading candidate in next year’s presidential election, Senator Gustavo Petro, warned that the government’s attempts to ban protests seeks to “create confrontations between the people and the police.”What we need to understand tomorrow is that the success of the strike does not depend on the success of protests. It is more than anything about ceasing activity.Senator Gustavo PetroHouse Representative Juanita Goebertus of the centrist Green Alliance opposition party urged her constituents not to take part in public protests, but to take part at the 6PM sound protests planned by the National Strike Committee.The majority of political parties have expressed their opposition of the tax reform that has increased tensions between the government and the population. national strike ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-suspends-right-to-pubic-protests-ahead-of-national-strike/,Colombia suspends right to ‘pubic’ protests ahead of national strike
" Colombia’s military illegally spied on organizers of Wednesday’s protests against far-right President Ivan Duque, leaked military intelligence documents indicate.The 36-page intelligence report was leaked to investigative journalism collective Hacker Fiscalia, according to exiled former prosecution investigator Richard Maok, who leads the collective.The alleged military intelligence documents identified 28 organizations that would be organizing 233 protests in opposition of Duque’s controversial tax reform proposals on Wednesday.National Army divisions were apparently informed about the protests preparations and the involved organizations within their jurisdiction.Alleged military spying abroadThe military allegedly also carried out intelligence operations in the United States, Canada and Europe where they said another seven protests were being organized.Colombian activists from Germany and the Netherlands confirmed they were planning protests in the cities in the alleged military intelligence report.No protest was planned in the Dutch city of The Hague, but “they called me to ask about it insistently,” a Colombian activist living in the Netherlands told Colombia Reports.Focus on ethnic minoritiesThe military paid extra attention to ethnic minorities, particularly in the southwestern Cauca province where native Colombians have suffered most from drug violence.The alleged intelligence report projected where indigenous gatherings would be held in Cauca and which “indigenous communities could protest in the rest of the country.”The use of military resources against civilians is illegal as these resources may only be used against objectives considered a threat to national security, not to benefit the political agenda of the government.Former National Army commander General Nicasio Martinez was forced to resign in late 2019 after the military was spying on civilians, including foreign journalists, which apparently didn’t stop the military.The intelligence reports leaked to Hacker Fiscalia indicate the military was again involved in a strategy to counter Wednesday’s anti-government protests.Witness testimonies from both the Netherlands and Germany indicated that apparent spies have been trying to infiltrate social organizations dedicated to human rights in Colombia. militaryMilitary intelligencenational strikenewslettersocial protests ",https://colombiareports.com/military-intelligence-spied-on-duque-critics-in-colombia-us-and-europe/,"Military intelligence spied on protest organizers in Colombia, US and Europe"
" Tensions in Colombia are rising as social organizations insist on organizing anti-government protests on Wednesday amid a coronavirus outbreak that has all but collapsed healthcare.Labor unions and other social organizations called for the strike day after the government of President Ivan Duque proposed its third tax reform earlier this month.Some of the organizations additionally claim they would organize street protests “with all biosafety protocols” to demand policies that promote “for life, peace and democracy.”Strike organizers dismiss health ministerHealth Minister Fernando Ruiz on Monday called on the strike organizers to postpone protests and “join this common effort of society to slow down the” spreading of the virus causing COVID-19.Teachers union Fecode rejected the call, claiming that the government’s refusal to adopt measures to fight poverty “obligates us to organize protests.”The government has not approved a basic income for us. We have to go out, we shouldn’t go out, but we have to. We teachers shouldn’t go out but we have to.Fecode spokesperson Omar ArangoSupporters of Duque and his far-right political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, embarked on an online campaign to discredit the strike organizers, which backfired.In response, Duque and the “uribistas” were scorned on social media.Local leaders divided over protestsBogota Mayor Claudia Lopez, a long-time critic of Duque and his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, said Monday that she would not allow mass gatherings claiming the capital’s hospital system is on the brink of collapse.Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero, whose healthcare system collapsed weeks ago, said he would be looking for extra intensive care units to “confront additional infections that a massive march could cause like that.”Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina said he would grant government employees a day off if the organizers agreed to postpone protests, but stressed “I won’t violate the right to mobilize and protest, and provide all guarantees.”Duque’s latest blunderThe protests organizers said they will call off the strike if Duque withdraws the tax proposal, which the president refuses despite the fact that the bill is opposed by almost all political parties.Duque could have prevented the latest wave of anti-government rage if he had consulted Congress about the bill that seeks to secure government revenue needed to deal with the coronavirus crisis.The president is now facing an almost certain defeat in Congress, increased social unrest and record-breaking COVID-19 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. national strike ",https://colombiareports.com/tensions-rise-in-colombia-ahead-of-national-strike/,Tensions rise in Colombia ahead of national strike
" Colombia’s security forces have been fighting guerrillas for more than 60 years, but may want to prepare for the possibility that a former guerrilla will become their commander-in-chief.The latest poll did not just confirm others that put opposition Senator Gustavo Petro in the lead of the 2022 election race, but indicated that the former member of the M-19 rebel group may be unbeatable.According to pollster Invamer, the progressive candidate has taken such a lead that if elections were held tomorrow, no candidate would stand a chance against Petro.Ahead of the first round, the progressive candidate would enjoy more than twice the support of the runner up, “extreme centrist” Sergio Fajardo.Invamer’s first round pollPetro marginalizes Duque alliesPetro’s lead over candidates associated with former President Alvaro Uribe, the alleged mafia boss of President Ivan Duque, has completely marginalized the candidates of the corruption-ridden government coalition.Unless the “Uribistas” are able to make peace with their political rivals that make up the liberal opposition, the far-right candidates seem to stand no chance.Ongoing revelations of the corruption and organized crime activity of Duque’s allies appear to have evaporated public support for the government allies.Of the Uribistas, only former Barranquilla Mayor Alejandro Char did not lose support, according to Invamer.Uribe’s son Tomas, who has been pushed forward to protect his family’s allegedly criminal interests, is apparently failing to impress the public despite being hyped by news media close to his family.Tomas Uribe, the latest heir of the narco-dynasty started by his grandfather, Medellin Cartel associate Luis Alberto Uribe.Liberal opposition also in crisisAlso the self-proclaimed “extreme centrists” are in crisis as the poll indicates a major shift in the electorate’s political preference.While Petro’s support would have skyrocketed from 25.9% in August last year to 38.3% this month, support for Fajardo dropped from 20.5% to 15.9%, according to Invamer.The progressive candidate has consistently urged to join forced with the liberals, claiming together they would be able to secure a decisive victory in the first round of the elections in May last year.Fajardo and his allies have been stand-offish about teaming up with Petro, a strategy that appears to be failing.According to Invamer, the collapse of the Uribistas did not spur an electoral shift to the center, but made many leap to the other side of the political spectrum.Those who identify themselves as politically ideological make up 83% of the electorate. A steady 17% of voters wants nothing to do with any ideology.Political bias of Colombia’s outspoken electoratePetro unbeatable?According to Ivamer’s preliminary poll, Petro’s extraordinary rise in popularity has made him all but invincible in a possible second round of elections for all candidates.The efforts of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party to stigmatize the opposition Senator as some kind of dangerous socialist doesn’t even appeal to the ruling party’s old base, according to Invamer.If Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez for some miracle would reach the second round, Petro would defeat Duque’s former running mate with a convincing 56% against 37%.Ramirez would receive the support of the upper class, but the coronavirus has marginalized this part of the population.Also Fajardo would also not stand a change, according to Invamer, which said that Petro would defeat his liberal rival with a comfortable 53% against 42%.Other candidates wouldn’t barely obtain half of the progressive leader who isn’t even allowed access to election campaign funds, according to the notoriously corrupt National Electoral Council.Plan B: killing a candidateParamilitary group AGC declares two dozen activists of “Colombia Humana” a “military objective.”An electoral victory for Petro would be historic.The security forces were never able to defeat one rebel group, but did take part in the successful assassination of three presidential candidates.In fact, no reformist candidate has survived taking on establish candidates since the assassination of Liberal Party dissident Jorge Eliecer Gaitan in 1948.Presidential candidates’ murders since 1948Petro survived and assassination attempt ahead of the 2018 elections, unlike late candidates Luis Carlos Galan, Carlos Pizarro and Bernardo Jamarillo in 1990Activists of the opposition senator’s political movement, Colombia Humana, have already been suffering assassination attempts and liberal lawmakers who have joined the presidential hopeful have received death threats.Petro’s chances to win the 2022 elections are significant, but so are the chances that the opposition senator will not survive the elections race.Whether this will keep Duque’s far-right allies in power in uncertain as none would be able to defeat the runner-up in the race, former Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo, according to Invamer. 2022 electionsColombia Humanaelection pollsGustavo Petro ",https://colombiareports.com/how-a-former-guerrilla-is-becoming-unbeatable-in-colombias-presidential-elections-race/,How a former guerrilla is becoming unbeatable in Colombia’s election race

" Colombia’s Comptroller Generals on Monday ordered to seize an engineering firm whose “visionary” late founder conceived the disastrous Hidroituango hydroelectric dam.The Comptroller General ordered to seize 13 bank accounts and 12 real estate properties of Integral SA, which designed the Hidroituango dam that nearly collapsed in 2018, months before completion.Another dynasty in ruinsAccording to the fiscal watchdog, the government contractors will have to pay $1.7 billion (COP4.2 trillion) for the disastrous project that was initially presented by co-founder Jose Tejada in 1969.The fiscal measures seek to recover damages allegedly caused by the disastrous work of the company whose co-founder is considered “one of the most prestigious engineers in Colombia” by the Medellin Chamber of Commerce.Jose Tejada Saenz is one of the most prestigious engineers in Colombia. Through his firm “Integral” he has generated progress and development for the whole society. Half a century of great engineering works in Antioquia and in the country had as a first line actor the firm modestly constituted in 1955 by Tejada and his friends and converted today into one of the largest and most distinguished companies in its field.Medellin Chamber of CommerceSince its foundation in 1955, Integral has become one of Colombia’s largest construction firms due to its close ties to the Medellin elite, which gave the company an advantage in bidding processes for major infrastructure projects.Saenz presented his idea to construct a dam in the Cauca, Colombia’s second largest river, in a 1969 environmental study.Former President Alvaro Uribe signed off on the company’s participation in a “promotional committee” that lobbied the dam when the far-right politician was governor of Antioquia in 1997.The plan sparked extreme violence in northern Antioquia where paramilitary groups sought to displace locals, which would allow EPM to cheaply purchase their land, and guerrillas violently opposed the project.The national government approved the construction of the Hidroituango dam designed by Tejada in 2009 when Uribe and Medellin’s public utilities company EPM formed a consortium in 2010 to effectively construct the dam that was supposed to provide 17% of Colombia’s energy in 2018.(Image: Andes University)From visionary to doomTejada was praised as a “visionary” by Medellin university EAFIT, which allowed one of the engineer’s heirs to write a paper on her own family for her masters in business administration in 2014.According to Thomas L. Harrison, in reference to whether an entrepreneur is born or made, in his book Instinct (2005), he states that genes are responsible for approximately half of the personality traits and the rest is linked to the environment in which we live. All these factors in José Tejada’s childhood were therefore a positive combination to become the person he would be in the future.Sarah ThenotThe dam project nearly collapsed months in early 2018, just months before it was supposed to be completed.The discharge tunnels designed by Tejada’s company blocked and the rapidly rising waters of the Cauca River threatened to flood the project.EPM workers were able to prevent flooding by using the turbine engine tunnel to discharge water, which allowed them to quickly finish building the $4 billion dam wall.The disaster forced authorities to relocate more than 100,000 people who were living downstream of Hidroituango.Many of the riverside homes will be demolished because of Hidroituango. (Image: Mariana Calvo)The aftermathThe disaster triggered a criminal investigation, and investigations by the Comptroller General’s Office and the Inspector General.The comptroller general announced investigations against 18 politicians and former EPM officials in 2018, but omitted Uribe from the probe.The former president one of the main promoters of the disastrous hydroelectric project, but is also the boss of President Ivan Duque, and all but untouchable.Tejada died in 2011 already. Despite his alleged visionary abilities, there exists no evidence indicating that the late engineer foresaw that his crappy idea to build a damn would ruin his company 10 years after his death.

" Medellin medical organizations urged humanitarian aid and a two-week lockdown to resuscitate the collapsed healthcare system in Colombia’s second largest city.The city of 2.5 million people entered in crisis last month after a new wave of coronavirus infections collapsed hospitals.According to the Health Secretary of the Antioquia province, more than 99% of Medellin’s intensive care units (ICU’s) are full, which is collapsing emergency healthcare in multiple cities.My shift begins. I have space in the ICU for two patients who are going through hell, but there is no ambulance to drive them. There are no ambulances available. Just to emphasize: the number of ICUs and their occupancy are only an indicator. The reality goes far beyond that and it’s shit!Bogota Internist Surella AcostaOn Monday, the capital of Antioquia reported a record number of 146 coronavirus-related deaths, one third of the 420 deaths reported in all of Colombia.On Wednesday, almost a quarter of Colombia’s 100,000 active coronavirus cases were reported in Antioquia, the home of approximately 13% of the country’s population.The saturation of Medellin’s hospital system puts doctors before the horrific position they have to provisionally decide who receives intensive care and who is condemned to an almost certain death.The Medellin Medicine Academy and nine other organizations called on acting Governor Luis Fernando Suarez to declare a “a strict quarantine for life for two weeks” to prevent mass death and allow hospitals to recover from “the general collapse of the healthcare services.”The organizations additionally urged to step up humanitarian aid for the poor, who are disproportionately exposed to the virus and affected by lockdowns.We urge for the need for humanitarian aid to the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population, with the support of all public sectors and private enterprises.Medellin medical organizationsThe vice-president of the Colombian Medical Federation called on Suarez to formally declare a healthcare collapse, which would trigger the formation of ethic committees that could decide on the provision and denial of intensive care.Suarez ignored the call and Health Minister Fernando Ruiz has consistently refused to acknowledge the crisis.What impotence. No one listens, no one takes responsibility, and we are losing lives while there is a resource to help them. We do not know what else to do. We only know that silence is not an option for us.Colombian Medical Federation vice-president Carolina CorchoTo aggravate the situation, Mayor Daniel Quintero said Thursday that Medellin’s hospitals have run out of COVID-19 shots, forcing them to pause efforts to vaccinate its residents.The government have consistently claimed that the crisis in Medellin and other cities is due to “lack of civil discipline” despite healthcare workers reiterating that the crisis is due to the authorities’ misrule.

No more divisions between isms: we are Colombia.President Ivan DuqueWithin two and a half years, Duque has lost the majority support in every age group, social class and political side, according to pollster Invamer.Whether any president in the history of Colombia has ever performed so poorly is impossible to say as polls haven’t been around that long.Duque failed to break the disapproval rating record low of his predecessor, former President Juan Manuel Santos, who on two occasions sunk his approval rating to 21%.The current president was on his way when his approval rating to 23% in February last year, but was saved by the coronavirus and now has the approval of 33%.Duque’s public approvalThe unique thing about Duque is that the president is able to bridge political, social and generational divides and find disapproval everywhere.While the far-right president founds most convincing disapproval among people who define themselves as left-leaning, Duque is rubbing the majority of people who consider themselves right-wing too.PoliticsWhen it comes to age, Duque continues to perform best — or not as disastrous rather — among people older than 55.However, also among those who have lived the partisan violence fueled by the Cold War, the majority of people disapprove of the president whose government has tried to revive the political division.AgeWhen it comes to wealth division, Duque finds the least disapproval among people who define themselves as lower class.The president enjoyed most support among the upper class shortly after his election, but seems to have spectacularly bungled this support, according to Invamer.WealthDuque’s unique ability to unite the country against him could be a major handicap for the president’s political allies running for office in next year’s congressional and presidential elections.More imminently, Duque may have become a lame duck president as congressional allies may want to distance themselves from the government if they want to successfully run for office again next year. approval ratingsIvan Duquenewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/ivan-duque-bridges-divides-as-colombia-unitedly-rejects-worst-president-ever/,Ivan Duque bridges divides as Colombia unitedly rejects ‘worst president ever’
" The chiefs of Colombia’s transitional justice system said Monday that the ongoing assassinations of former FARC fighters and community leaders is threatening their work.In a joint statement, the presidents of war crimes tribunal JEP, the Truth Commission and the Special Unit for Missing Persons urged the Ombudsman to take action.According to JEP President Eduardo Cifuentes, the assassinations of former guerrillas do not just end their cooperation with justice but “discourage the contributions to the truth” about the FARC’s war crimes.Also in the case of human rights defenders and community leaders, the terror caused by the assassinations threatens to silence communities’ participation to the transitional justice system.“Violence terrorizes. That’s the paralyzing message they seek to send with each assassination, ” the JEP’s chief magistrate said.When the perpetrators of violence silence [rights] defenders and former FARC members, they not only hurt them and their families; they also deprive society of an irreplaceable fragment of truth and a source of reparation.JEP President Eduardo CifuentesThe terrorAt least 276 demobilized guerrillas have been assassinated since the FARC signed a 2016 peace agreement with former President Juan Manuel Santos and December last year, the transitional justice system revealed.More than nine out of 10 assassinated former FARC guerrillas were cooperating with the war crimes tribunal, according to the tribunal’s president.Additionally, 900 social leaders have been assassinated during the same period, according to the transitional justice system, whose estimates are lower than those of most think tanks.Almost half of the assassinated social leaders were actively involved with one of the transitional justice system’s bodies, according to Cifuentes.Assassination during peace process The existential threat to transitional justiceThe terror is threatening the core purpose of the JEP, the Truth Commission and the missing persons unit to effectively secure peace, said the war crimes tribunal’s president.Without people who actively and openly support the transition, basically because they are afraid to join the Integral System, it is devoid of content and risks becoming a paper institution.JEP President Eduardo CifuentesCifuentes explicitly called on the Ombudsman’s Office to pressure State institutions that have been reluctant to implement the peace deal, and specifically the strategies designed to protect its participants.“The question isn’t how to confront the current situation… It is when, rather, if tomorrow won’t be too late,” said the JEP president.“It is evident that the efforts made so far are insufficient,” according to Cifuentes.The speed of the agreement’s implementation is too slow and the country doesn’t support more delays.JEP President Eduardo Cifuentes armed conflictJEPpeace processtruth commissionUnit for the Search of Missing Persons ",https://colombiareports.com/terror-is-threatening-colombias-transitional-justice-system/,‘Terror is threatening Colombia’s transitional justice system’

" Combating the coronavirus in Colombia’s remote Putumayo province poses entirely different challenges than in the country’s more developed regions.The southern province almost couldn’t be further away from the capital Bogota and almost half of Putumayo’s 360,000 inhabitants live in the countryside, away from any hospitals.Almost as many epidemics as roadsPutumayo has only two roads that traverse the province from north to south, one from the capital Mocoa to La Hormiga and another one from La Tagua to Puerto Leguizamo.The region’s lack of infrastructure may have slowed down the coronavirus, but has historically made healthcare almost impossible to access for the rural population.If the people from the Barrialosa indigenous reserve need to go to the hospital, for example, they would have to walk five kilometers to the Caqueta river and travel another 100 kilometers by boat to reach the town of Puerto Guzman.Puerto Guzman’s hospital (Image: World Health Organization)Underdeveloped and corrupt healthcare systemThe hospital of Puerto Guzman only provides basic healthcare. Putumayo’s 31 intensive care units are located in the capital.When jailed Governor Buanerges Rosero fell ill in July last year, the politician was flown to Cali where “we can give him better and faster attention,” Rosero’s counterpart Clara Luz Roldan from Valle del Cauca said.Why that was became evident in November when Mocoa’s hospital director resigned for being unqualified.The governor was detained because the Supreme Court additionally suspected that Roseo’s had kept almost $300,000 of a $950,000 budget for the purchase of 10 ambulances.Soldier picks up a patient in Orito (Image: National Army)Contradicting reports on the pandemicAccording to the Health Ministry, 2.3% of Putumayo’s population tested positive to COVID-19, a fraction of the 9.2% registered in the capital Bogota.According to indigenous organization ONIC, which created its own monitoring system, more than half of the indigenous communities had been infected.Official numbers are unreliable because health authorities in the southern province have tested less than 12,000 people of whom a staggering 8,464 tested positive to COVID-19. When it comes to active cases, the national government and regional health authorities report different statistics. According to the Health Ministry, 69 people were ill on Wednesday while Putumayo authorities said this number was 164.Bogota claimed 10 people were receiving intensive care and regional authorities said seven.How many people died is also disputed. According to the Putumayo Health Secretary, 330 people died during the pandemic while the Health Ministry has confirmed only 310.Either way, this means that the fatality rate in Putumayo would be twice as high as in Bogota or the more developed Antioquia province.Hospital in Puerto Asis (Image: Seris IPS)Slow vaccinationThe regional government said Wednesday that 10,979 people, including the province’s 4,185 healthcare workers, have received their first COVID-19 shot as part of the National Vaccination Plan.Almost one third of these shots were administered in the capital Mocoa.This means that 2.8% of the population would have received their first vaccination shot, which is considerably less than in the much more developed Antioquia province where 7.2% of the people received their first shot.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said he would send less vaccines to Putumayo and other rural provinces where the vaccination drive proves challenging because of their failure to keep up with his National Vaccination Plan.The United Nations teamed up with the ONIC to promote vaccination among Putumayo’s 11 indigenous peoples after tensions over the lack of communication with native Colombian organizations over plans to vaccinate indigenous peoples in remote areas like the reserves in Putumayo. coronavirusnewsletterPutumayo ",https://colombiareports.com/the-struggle-to-combat-coronavirus-in-colombias-remote-regions/,The struggle to combat COVID-19 in one of Colombia’s most remote regions
" Colombia’s justice minister took another step towards the aerial spraying of coca, which scholars believe will condemn the country to a new cycle of extreme violence.The decree that regulates the use of the herbicide glyphosate is far-right President Ivan Duque’s latest push to resume the aerial spraying of coca.Justice Minister Wilson Ruiz stressed that the decree does not allow the immediate resumption of the controversial counternarcotics strategy.Instead, the government is trying to comply with a 2017 Constitutional Court ruling that allowed the resumption of aerial spraying using the poisonous chemical only as a last resort and under strict conditions.Opponents fiercely oppose the resumption of aerial spraying as they fear that the government’s “stubborn” denial of of reality will quickly escalate armed conflict.The decree is a defiant act of stubbornness that demonstrates that they are not interested in listening to the international community, nor to the academic community, and much less to the communities that would be affected by the spraying.Counternarcotics expert Isabel PereiraDuque and his ministers have been trying to blame “drug trafficking” for the violence in Colombia, contradicting evidence indicating that illegal armed groups are taking advantage of Duque’s misrule to take control over the countryside.“Chemical warfare”According to counternarcotics think tank Indepaz, Ruiz’s restrictions on the use of glyphosate are so vague they effectively constitute “chemical warfare” and allow the aerial spraying of pretty much anything.It is very symptomatic that when indicating the areas excluded from aerial spraying operations with herbicides, neither the Forest Reserve Zones as a whole, nor the areas of subsistence crops, agricultural activity, homes, schools, etc., are included.Think tank IndepazDuque is desperate, however, as his refusal to implement a peace deal and his pursuit of notoriously ineffective forced eradication have so far only strengthened illegal armed groups, including drug traffickers.Potential cocaine production soared to a record high in 2019 and global cocaine seizures went through the roof in 2020, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).The government is desperately downplaying a surge in massacres and political violence that is terrorizing the countryside.This decision taken by the government is another ignition for war and not to the search for peace, and we are concerned that this could trigger complex situations in the region.Coca growers federation COCCAMDoubling downInstead of implementing peace policies and resuming the crop substitution program agreed with farmers, the president has been trying to double down using aerial spraying.Experts have repeatedly warned this will further escalate violence without this affecting the drug trade .Doubling down on eradication and potentially aerial spraying could intensify violence by pushing farmers into the clutches of armed groups, without stopping the replanting of coca.International Crisis GroupWhether the Constitutional Court will allow Duque’s strategy is entirely unknown, which could result in the president’s biggest humiliation since last year when press revealed Duque was elected with the help of a drug trafficking organization in 2018.According to Indepeaz, Duque’s self-proclaimed counternarcotics strategy resembles “a territorial, populational and national security control strategy” rather than a “a policy to dismantles drug trafficking mafias” like the one that helped him become president.The drug traffickers will find their business “only marginally affected” while Duque will only weaken himself even further, according to the Study Center for Security and Drugs of the Andes University.The drug traffickers’ business is only marginally affected, but it generates major social impacts such as the displacement of vulnerable communities that are forced to resettle in new areas to replant in order to earn income for their families. This further intensifies the social conflict and tensions between communities and the State, weakening its image and legitimacy in the territories.Study Center for Security and Drugs“The government has been completely deaf to criticism,” according to counternarcotics expert Isabel Pereira.Consequently, Duque is likely to further “weaken the legitimacy of the State” and increase “the violence and intensity of conflict, both on the short and the long term” according to Los Andes’ Study Center for Security and Drugs.By the time this results in a significant increase in guerrilla attacks and the assassination of civilians, “Colombia’s worst-ever president” would long have left office. aerial fumigationcoca cultivationcounternarcoticsDrug policydrug traffickingIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/duques-chemical-warfare-against-coca-to-fuel-for-more-war-in-colombia/,Duque’s ‘chemical warfare’ against coca ‘fuel for more war’ in Colombia

" While the governments of Colombia and Venezuela blame each other for a recent outburst of violence in the border region, ELN guerrillas who effectively control the region are calling for a ceasefire.The guerrillas apparently refuse to get involved in violence between alleged FARC dissidents and the Venezuelan military that has killed at least eight soldiers over the past two weeks.The ELN’s control over Colombia’s Arauca province and Venezuela’s Apure state is virtually undisputed, but they seem to shun the fighting and the mutual blame game between Bogota and Caracas.In an apparent attempt to outdo the incoherent rambling of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Colombia’s Foreign Minister Claudia Blum on Thursday claimed that “terrorists like the ELN and FARC dissidents for year have found refuge in Venezuela.”The ELN have been active in both countries for thee centuries at least, unlike the FARC’s dissident 10th Front, which rearmed in 2018 after attempts to sabotage their peace process.A 200-year history lesson on the ELN’s war with Colombia’s stateAccording to the foreign minister, Maduro is fighting the FARC dissident to try to divert attention way “in regards to the complicit relationship between the dictatorship and terrorists.”Blum conveniently forgot that President Ivan Duque is associated with far-right death squads that are terrorizing Colombia and won the 2018 elections with the help of a drug trafficking organization.Days before, Maduro claimed that the dissident guerrillas fighting Colombia’s authorities were effectively sent by Duque who would be “up to his neck in this plan” in a conspiracy to overthrew the Venezuelan government.Venezuela warns border violence could spark war with ColombiaThe ELN took advantage of the two politicians’ delusional rhetoric to reiterate its call for a bilateral ceasefire after having spent the past few years expanding control over the countryside.“An agreement on a bilateral and temporary ceasefire with the National Government to better confront COVID-19 creates conditions” to resume mediated peace talks with Duque, the ELN’s chief negotiator “Pablo Beltran” told media on Thursday.While talking peace, the guerrillas have used the deteriorated ties between Caracas and Bogota, and both government’s growing crises, to impose guerrilla rule over neglected border regions like Arauca.Maduro in 2019 broke off diplomatic relations that Duque has refused to reestablish, which would allow both countries to cooperate and recover control over the long neglected and increasingly unstable border.The violence on the Venezuelan side of the border has displaced approximately 5,000 people over the past two weeks. armed conflictborder securityClaudia BlumELNVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/eln-goes-diplomatic-as-colombia-and-venezuela-bicker-over-border-security/,ELN goes diplomatic as Colombia and Venezuela bicker over border security

According to Indepaz, 41 were killed in the first three months of 2021 against 89 during the same period last year.The country is submerged in poverty, misery, unemployment and massacres.Native Colombian leader Martha PeraltaThe violence in CaucaFive of this year’s massacres and five assassinations of social leaders took place in Cauca, one of the Pacific region’s historically neglected provinces.Following the 2017 demobilization and the disarmament of former guerrilla group FARC, Cauca has seen a surge in violence caused by the ELN guerrilla group, paramilitaries, drug traffickers and FARC dissidents.These groups have taken advantage of the security forces’ failure to assume control of the region and have violently been vying for control over mineral reserves and drug trafficking routes.This has mainly affected the native Colombian population, whose leaders have tried to keep illegal armed groups out of indigenous reserves.Government responseThe government of far-right President Ivan Duque has tried to evade responsibility for the increase in violence and armed conflict many blame on the government’s failure to implement the peace deal with the FARC.In a press conference, Defense Minister Diego Molano said Wednesday that the majority of the recent massacres were due to “disputes over criminal rackets” and “not like the massacres in the past.”According to the government, “drug trafficking is directly related to the violence, the killings of social leaders and the [forced] displacement of the population.The ongoing violence in Cauca and other parts of Colombia is also due to conflicts over land and natural resources, exactly like in the past. armed conflictCaucamassacresnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/southwest-colombia-massacre-highlights-ongoing-increase-in-violence/,Southwest Colombia massacre highlights ongoing increase in violence
" Some of Colombia’s largest cities have been forced to reinstate lockdowns as a new surge in COVID-19 infections is knocking down hospitals and slowing down vaccination efforts.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz and Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez declared an orange alert in the capital on Thursday, restricting its 7 million inhabitants’ access to shopping centers, banks and public buildings and a nightly curfew.Authorities in Medellin and Barranquilla were forced to impose a 24-hour curfew until early Tuesday after their hospital systems collapsed.The Brazilian threatValle del Cauca Governor Clara Luz Roldan warned that she may shut down Cali and surrounding cities as a COVID-19 variant from Brazil appears to be saturating hospitals.According to Valle del Cauca Health Secretary Maria Cristina Lesmes, more than half of the intensive care units (ICU’s) in Cali and surrounding cities are being occupied by people between 20 and 59.The coronavirus that initially appeared in China in late 2019 was mainly dangerous and potentially fatal for people older than 60.The Brazilian strain appears to be considerably more dangerous for younger people.I have no doubt that Colombia is already dealing with the Brazilian COVID mutation. This could explain the high infection rates and the complexity of patients arriving in our intensive care units.Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan OspinaCOVID-19 infections and deathsNational Vaccination ChaosThe increased pressure on hospital personnel further bogged down President Ivan Duque’s National Vaccination Plan that had already descended into chaos.Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero was forced to retract a claim that all people of 70 and older were able to get vaccines after large numbers of people appeared at hospitals that had no vaccines.Cali’s health secretary said Thursday that it was forced to delay the administration of the second and final vaccine shot due to shortages.Duque’s health minister has insisted that 80% of Colombia’s 51 million inhabitants will be vaccinated by the end of the year, but data from the ministry indicates that meeting this target at the current speed would take at least two years.Meanwhile, the Brazilian coronavirus strain seems to be raging through the cities like an epidemiological wildfire that threatens to grind the government’s economic reactivation plan to a halt.

" Former Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo asked Colombia’s Prosecutor General to revise a controversial decision to investigate the candidate in next year’s presidential election.The prosecution has been accused of political persecution after announcing it would investigate Fajardo for seeking a $77 million loan when he was governor of the Antioquia province in 2013.The investigation implied that the presidential candidate should have foreseen a global commodity crisis that sunk the value of the peso in 2014.Colombia’s prosecution opens investigation against opposition presidential candidateFajardo’s defense attorney, Mauricio Pava, formally requested Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa “to convene a technical-legal committee” that could revoke the decision to open an investigation.Barbosa, one of President Ivan Duque’s best friends, has been criticized by politicians from and economists over the investigation against of the favorites in the 2022 election race.The chief prosecutor had already lost credibility after announcing an investigation against Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez and trying to end an investigation against far-right former President Alvaro Uribe.Lopez has been a long-time critic of Uribe, the allegedly criminal political patron of both Barbosa and Duque.Francisco Barbosa: Colombia’s saddest excuse for a chief prosecutor ever?Both allies and rivals of Fajardo have accused the chief prosecutor of trying to discredit the runner up in preliminary election polls after opposition Senator Gustavo Petro.Fajardo was already being investigated by Comptroller General Luis Felipe Cordoba, one of Barbosa’s best friends, over alleged negligence in the construction of Colombia’s largest hydro-electric dam.The announced prosecution investigation against the candidate added concerns about the fairness of the election of a successor of Duque, who is suffering low approval ratings.Uribe and his far-right Democratic Center party are being investigated for allegedly conspiring with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 elections in Duque’s favor. 2022 electionsFrancisco BarbosaProsecutor General's Officesergio fajardo ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-prosecution-asked-to-revise-investigation-against-presidential-candidate/,Colombia’s prosecution asked to revise investigation against presidential candidate

" A third surge in COVID-19 infections is collapsing hospitals in Colombia as if the coronavirus pandemic were a game of dominoes.The University Hospital, one of Medellin’s largest, said Tuesday that its intensive care units and hospital beds are full, and that it could no longer provide emergency care.Medellin ombudsman William Yeffer Vivas said in the evening that almost 98% of the city’s intensive care units (ICU’s) are full and that more than 100 people were waiting for others to either die or recuperate.Vivas also criticized the government of President Ivan Duque whose National Vaccination Plan has been plagued by the administration’s trademark misrule.Coronavirus infections and deathsMedellin heading for disasterThe regional branch of the National Association of Internists and Resident Physicians (ANIR) begged the national government and Governor Luis Fernande Suarez to impose a two-week lockdown, claiming that “the pandemic is out of control.”The emergency, hospitalization capacity, intensive care and medium care units have collapsed.” Antioquia branch of the National Association of Internists and Resident Physicians“The hospital collapsed,” a nurse from the Fundadores hospital said Sunday already after the baker from across the street observed the growing number of people waiting for medical attention and asked: “shouldn’t you be at work?”The hospital collapses in Medellin and cities in the Caribbean region come weeks before an expected surge in hospitalizations as a consequence of the Holy Week, one of the most important religious events of the year.The ANIR fiercely criticized Duque and his Health Minister Fernando Ruiz for misinforming the public about the progress of their troubled vaccination drive.Ruiz insisted in Congress that the government will continue to try to vaccinate 35 million people before the end of the year despite being unable to execute the unprecedented vaccination drive.We always committed ourselves to start the National Vaccination Plan in February, and we fulfilled it. Now our commitment continues to be that all 35 million Colombians will be vaccinated by 2021.Health ministerNational Vaccination Plan progressKilling Colombia’s labor forceEpidemiologist Yessica Giraldo  told newspaper El Tiempo that there has been an alarming rise in the hospitalizations and deaths of people between 20 and 59 who are considered a low-risk group by the government and the bulk of the labor force.The most serious infections and cases are being seen in the mainly productive population, the people who make up the labor and productive force of the country, which if you look at the data of the [National Health Institute] INS are between 40 and 49, followed by 30-39 and even 20 to 29. Not to mention that there has also been a slight increase in the affectation of adolescents with respect to what we were dealing with, although not so drastic.Epidemiologist Yessica GiraldoThe observations made by Giraldo coincide with those made by analysts in Brazil who claim that data indicates that a coronavirus strain from that country is not only more infectious, but more dangerous for younger people.This is further aggravating tensions between Colombia’s employers, who don’t want to close their factories an shops, and the country’s employees, who might consider their lives more valuable than a $250/month minimum wage. coronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-hospitals-collapsing-covid-19-vaccination-drive-in-chaos/,"Colombia’s hospitals collapsing, COVID-19 vaccination drive in chaos"
" Colombia’s ethnic discrimination reached the point that 31% of people who identified themselves as African descendants in 2005 no longer wish to identify themselves as such.According to statistics agency DANE, some 2.9 million of Colombia’s population identified themselves as black in the 2018 census compared to 4.3 million during the previous one in 2005.Colombia’s ethnic minorities have disproportionally been the victim of armed conflict and ethnic violence for more than 500 years, but the recent changes do not account for the more the 31% reduction in those who identify as themselves as Afrocolombian.The 1.4 million drop is largely due to children under 15, who seem to have massively abandoned their African heritage.In the same census, DANE estimated that the Afrocolombian minority has in fact slightly increased since 2005.Centuries of slavery, persistent ethnic violence, and relentless discrimination appear to be the final straw for a significant portion of black youth.The 500 years of constant humiliations, scientific and religious racism and the extreme violence  may not have resulted in “whitening society,” but the reduction of black pride may strengthen the the sense of superiority of  Colombia’s “super caste.”White supremacy in Colombia | Part 1: Kill the Indians!African importsThe concept of white supremacy was introduced by the Spanish almost immediately after their arrival in 1500. This initially only affected native Colombians until their near extinction spurred the import of slaves from Africa.The first African slaves arrived in Colombia in 1529, according to US historian US historian Frederick Bowser, but without consent of the Spanish authorities that didn’t grant slave licenses until 1533.The Spanish government initially only granted licenses to conquistadors who needed fighters to conquer the country, public officials who needed to maintain order and church officials.The rapid extinction of native Colombians left the royal household without a labor force to work in the gold mines and in agriculture.Cartagena became the main port for human property after 1595 when the Dutch and the English got involved, and the Spanish crown allowed anyone to buy African “settlers.”Until Madrid allowed the “free trade” of human beings in 1791, state authorities strictly regulated their import to prevent the arrival of worthless human merchandise, and be able to set a fixed price per “unit.”The problem was that much of the merchandise was worthless on arrival as many slaves were either near death or suffering “eye defects, missing teeth, sores on the legs, phlegm,” not to mention scurvy, shingles, hernias, stomach ruptures or broken ribs. Some even showed uniquely human symptoms like “permanent melancholy.”State authorities introduced a measuring system, the “Piece of the Indies,” that allowed fixed prices per “unit” using a method calling “palming.”People would be branded one unit if they were between 18 and 35 and taller than seven palms. People shorter than seven palms were only two-thirds of a unit, so three of them were sold as two units. Toddlers and their mothers were only one unit.Once the people were palmed and all units were branded, the slaves were off to the market.Freedom for cannon fodderSimon BolivarThe Spanish empire began collapsing in 1800. King Charles IV found himself at risk of going from being the emperor of a colonial superpower to becoming a colony of France after the invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1807 and the 1809 call for independence by white elites in Ecuador and Bolivia.Ecuadorean royalist Antonio Villavicencio asked the Spanish court to allow the children of slaves to born free to prevent “that the slaves will seek [freedom] themselves and even achieve it by violent and coercive means.”Villavicencio’s idea would also create division between slaves and their revolutionary owners, but died when Napoleon put his brother on the Spanish throne in 1810 and Bolivar stages a coup in Caracas.Colombia’s slaveholders began infighting in what is now known as the “Foolish Fatherland” period, that allowed some slaves to escape and find liberty in slave enclaves.Bolivar’s revolution failed and the general went into exile in 1815, first to Jamaica and then Haiti whose population of largely former slaves had been independent since 1804 after defeating Napoleon.The general promised to free slaves in 1816 if they helped him overthrow colonial rule. Some 200 slaves joined Bolivar’s 650 men and began the liberation campaign that would expel the Spanish in 1819.The Liberator never fulfilled his promise and controversially ordered the execution of three black commanders who helped him free Colombia.From slavery to assigned laborBust of Jose Felix de Restrepo in Sabaneta, AntioquiaFollowing the creation of the Republic of Great Colombia, Bolivar wrote the assembly that would compose the constitution that “I implore the confirmation of the absolute freedom of the slaves, as I would implore my life and the life of the Republic.”A year later, however, the general wrote his second in command, General Francisco de Paula Santander, that he would rather see slaves “acquire their rights on the battlefield,” partly “for their dangerous numbers to be diminished.”Will it not be useful for them to acquire their rights on the battlefield, and for their dangerous numbers to be diminished by powerful and legitimate means? Simon BolivarOutspoken abolitionists like Jose Felix de Restrepo were forced to compromise to “destroy slavery without destroying the owners” through the so-called “freedom of the womb” principle.Great Colombia’s 1821 constitution maintained slavery, but banned the import of slaves and allowed the future children of slaves to obtain citizenship and be “free.”The children of the slaves who are born from the day of the publication of this law in the provincial capitals will be free, and as such their names will be registered in the civic records of the municipalities and in the parish books.Law 1 of 1821These children, however, were still forced to carry out “useful trades and professions” assigned to them by their parents’ white owners.In the event that because they have reached the age of eighteen the young people are relieved of the power of their mother’s masters, it will be the obligation of the latter to inform the board that will be discussed later about the conduct and behavior of aforementioned young people, so that the assignment of useful trades and professions promoted with the government.CongressThe buying and selling of slaves was banned in 1925, which provided the family of Representative Joaquin Mosquera from the southwestern city of Popayan with a lucrative business opportunity, the illegal slave trade, and a bright political future.From assigned labor to apprenticeshipThe granting of citizenship to the children of slaves was frustrated by Colombia’s first civil war, the War of the Supremes, that began literally weeks before these children were allowed to request citizenship.At the end of the war in 1842, the government of President Pedro Alcantara decided to suspend the granting of citizenship for another seven years and impose an interim period of “apprenticeship” by decree.This apprenticeship would allow slave owners to “educate or instruct” their slaves’ children about citizenship and force “vagrants” who escaped to join the army.Slave owners saw no benefit in investing in their human property and preferred selling their slaves illegally in Peru. Their power was dwindling though while unrest among slaves was growing.Slave ownership in ColombiaAbolition triggers slaveholders rebellionBy 1950, authorities found that less than 600 children of slaves had effectively obtained freedom through the 1921 manumission program and tensions rose further.Slaves began organizing public protests to demand their immediate release instead of gradual abolition, which received support from pro-democracy organizations who were inspired by a wave of revolutions in Europe.Under pressure, President Jose Hilario Lopez proposed to abolish slavery as part of a number of reforms.Congress agreed on May 21, 1851, that all slaves would be free on January 1 the next year.To indemnify slave holders, they would receive bonds for slaves who weren’t born free that could be cashed in with interest until 1876.Anti-abolitionist landowners from the southwestern Cauca province rose up the next day with the support of landowners from Choco and Antioquia where slavery was still common.Minor anti-abolitionist revolts were reported in other strongholds of the anti-democratic Conservative Party like Boyaca, Tolima, Cundinamarca and Santander.The War of 1851 ended on September 10 when the National Army defeated the latest anti-abolitionists in Rionegro, Antioquia.The abolition racketDespite having lost the war, the slave owners were not defeated and convinced Congress to issue a second law, claiming the original abolition law did not compensate them for all their slaves.The second abolition law was enacted on April 17, 1852, and made it clear that slave owners never registered slaves’ children and grandchildren who were born after 1821.Congress agreed to also indemnify the slave owners for the countless people who had been enslaving illegally.While thousands of former slaves were able to start a life in liberty, others had no option but to continue working for their former masters, but under new conditions.Plantation owners, for example, would rent small plots of land to former slaves using a business model that would be called sharecropping after the abolition of slavery in the United States in 1865.The Mosquera family saw their illegal slave trade racket fall to pieces and also changed their business model.Instead of selling gold mined by their slaves they began charging former slaves for mining on their property near the Pacific port city of Buenaventura.The former slaves’ “misuse” of freedomFamous geographer Agustin Codazzi traveled to Choco in 1953 and concluded that former slaves in the Pacific province were “misusing their recently acquired freedom” as they were living off agriculture and fishing “in absolute independence” of their former masters.The individuals of the [“African race”] used to engage in the exploitation of mines; but today — making misuse of the newly acquired freedom — have mostly abandoned this job to live in absolute independence.Geographer Agustin CodazziThe geographer returned to the region in 1862, this time with his fellow-geographer Felipe Perez, who reported to the governor that the former slaves who had escaped exploitation “lacked love for work and an ambition for the comforts of civilized life.”If this strong and robust race had a love of work and an ambition for the comforts of civilized life, they could enrich themselves quickly and exchange his miserable huts for comfortable and warm houses, the pieces of wood they use to sit for good and soft furniture; his ugly nakedness for elegant clothes, and his ignorance, or at least that of his children, for the first and most indispensable rudiments of teaching. But for this it would be necessary to work constantly on minerals, to extract the rich metal, to pile up gold (which is not lacking) in order to enjoy later a less wild and more pleasant life; and this is difficult in the present state of those populations, void of a healthy example.”Felipe PerezCodazzi concluded that the former slaves were of “a race that spends all his days in utter laziness” and were “of no use for the progress of the country.”Curiously, the geographers’ opinion echoed those of fierce anti-abolitionists like Mosquera and Representative Geronimo Torres, who in 1922 claimed that slaves were “apathic, idle by nature” and “uneducated” who, “separated from the necessary vigilance of the masters to manage their conduct, would cause a fatal shock to this political body.”Selective memoryPresident Juan Jose NietoCodazzi and Perez had already forgotten that Colombia’s first and only black president, Juan Jose Nieto, hadn’t even left office more than a year before their trip to Choco.Nieto made history when he proclaimed himself president less than ten years after the abolishment of slavery, but was being removed from Colombia’s history books as carefully as the illegal slave trading practices of his successor, four-time President Tomas Cipriano Mosquera.Scientific racism and clerical recismLike French writer Josephe Artur de Gobineau in his 1855 book “An Essay on the Inequality of Races,” Codazzi and Perez were experimenting with “scientific racism,” a pseudo scientific endeavor to help European descendants convince themselves they were superior than African descendants.One pseudo-scientific belief that was relatively widespread among the urban elites in the capital, and cities lie Medellin and Cali, was that geography, and particular their cities elevated location in the Andes mountain created an environment geographical conditions that were more favorable for superior whites than those who were living in the traditional slave territories along the pacific and Caribbean coasts.Other prominent thinkers believed that the mere existence of people other than of pure European descent in Colombia posed an existential threat to white superiority as anyone would feel entitled to the same rights and privileges.Surely La Casas and the advisers of Carlos Quinto did not imagine that by introducing the blood of the negros in Colombia, in the form of merchandise, they were preparing for a more or less near future not only the advent of a very courageous and completely Christian democracy, but also the solution of the great problem of the mixing, to a certain extent, of the different races To throw a new race to the bottom of Colombia, implied introduce a new force there — latent or passive force at the beginning, which is true — but that must explode one day, after verifying its infusion in the body of the society. A new race had to be a new element of blending, of mixtures; and to create a mixed society was to prepare one of blood, the starting point of democracy of ideas and law. Anywhere races cannot claim purity, none can aspire supremacy — all interests become intertwined, and the regime of equality becomes also the only possible one. To demonstrate the accuracy of this idea it is enough to remember that the creoles, the blacks and the mestizos were, since 1820, the most energetic and indomitable soldiers of the Colombian independence.Author Jose Maria SamperColombia’s intellectual descendWhile offensive to many now, these Colombian intellectuals were pretty much of the same wavelength as their contemporaries in other parts of the world where “racism science” slowly began making place for “eugenics,” another pseudo science that that proposed Charles Darwin’s evolution theories could be use to better mankind.One of the most prominent proponents of the involvement of the Church and the reestablishment of feudal classes, that included racial segregation, was former slave owner, politician and author Sergio Arboleda, who proposed the revival of an aristocracy.In the first line we find the nobiliary aristocracy, made up of European Spaniards and white Creoles, mixed in part with the indigenous nobility. This class, although less numerous, is the only one with the moral, physical and intellectual resources necessary to give society tone and direction, and, of course, the only one responsible for the fate of the country. Next comes what we can call the middle class, to which belong the non-noble whites, the mestizos, the Indians who have risen from their ordinary situation to a higher position in society, and, finally, the mulattos and free blacks. The third class is made up of black slaves, and the last and most numerous are the tributary Indians. As a link between them all is the secular and regular clergy, which, although belonging for the most part to the white race, is strongly tinged with the other two, and is respected, revered and cared for by all.Sergo Arboleda (1861)What was particularly in Colombia ahead of the so-called “Regeneration” was that reactionary, anti-democratic and racist thought was fueled by conservative Catholics who claimed democracy was against God’s will unlike white supremacy.When we speak of the colonial epoch as three centuries of servitude, and with this we say what we know of it, we show crass ignorance and stupid contempt for history and for the men who preceded us in the manner of those who here and in Europe call the Middle Ages a period of barbarism and darkness. Those were times of Christian civilization, although imperfect, in which the germs of many benefits that we now enjoy were developed.Miguel Antonio CaroReligion, language, customs and traditions: none of this we have created; all this we have received having come to us from generation to generation, and from hand to hand, so to speak, from the time of the conquest and in the same way it will pass to our children and grandchildren as a precious deposit and rich heritage of civilized races.Miguel Antonio CaroLaureano Gomez, a.k.a. “The Monster.”During the “Conservtive Hegemony” between 1884 and 1930, arguably the most destructive politician in Colombia’s history, Laureano Gomez, rose to prominence.The conservative politicians quickly developed an admiration of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and surrounded him with racists.Gomez became convinced of the necessity to “whiten society” to preserve and promote civilization and prevent the Reestablishment of democracy when the Liberal Party took power again in 1930.The politician was strongly influenced by psychiatrist Miguel Jimenez, an outspoken white supremacist and supporter of Eugenics who had dedicated an entire book to “Colombia’s race problems.”Jimenez also believed that the different skin colors in Colombia had much to do with the altitude where people lived.In the subtropical zone of a new continent, three racial stocks have been juxtaposed: one aboriginal and two imported in recent times (four centuries in human evolution is a very short time). Of these three ethnic nuclei, the aboriginal one is in all probability a dependency of the great Mongolian family; the other two are, one of Aryan or European extraction and the other of African origin. Thus, the three great human varieties have come together on our soil: the yellow, the white and the black.Miguel Jimenez (1920)The fascist politician, however, had an outspoken concern as he believed that “the blacks” would condemn any civilization to chaos, and political and economic instability.In the nations of the Americas where blacks predominate, disorder also reigns. Haiti is the classic example of turbulent and irresponsible democracy. In countries where the Negro has disappeared, as in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, it has been possible to establish an economic and political organization with solid bases of stability.Laureano GomezOther racist intellectuals shared Gomez’s concern that Afrocolombians would “darken” or “africanize” the Colombians who had been able to prevent to segregate themselves from people of color.Physician Luis Lopez believed white Colombians would be able to maintain their skin color by selective breeding, strict immigration laws that would keep all colored people out.Jimenez proposed to test Afrocolombian’s blood that would allow them to recognize possible weaknesses that could be exploited in order to gradually exterminate them.White supremacy in Colombia | Part 2: migratory racismThe creation of a racist cultureGomez and his racist buddies would continue conspiring about possibly ethnic cleaning scenarios until Enrique Olaya was elected president in 1930 and sent the fascist to Nazi Germany.While in Europe, the Conservative politician became a major admirer of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco until he returned in 1936 to start newspaper “El Siglo,” which was inspired by the anti-democratic ideals of his party and the Spanish dictator.After his close ally Mariano Ospina, another fascist, took office in 1946 the country was slowly descending in a civil war.Gomez took office in 1952 and tried to pass a series of Fascist bills in 1952, but was deposed by the military in 1952.The fascist leader received political asylum in Spain until he was allowed to return in 1960. Five years later, the infamous former president was dead.His political legacy, “Laureanismo,” continued to inspire fascists who would later team up with President Alvaro Uribe and concert their fascist idol’s profoundly racist ideology in what is now called “Uribismo.”White supremacy is not limited to Colombia’s far-right, but has become part of mainstream culture in which Afrocolombians are excluded to take part, according to political scientist Daniela Maturana.Afro populations have fewer opportunities. And these situations mean that they have less dialogue with academia, with businessmen, with the State, and this leads you to become invisible to society. That is why these ghettos are created in the cities, as a measure to protect themselves, because they say: the State does not look at us, neither do the businessmen, we are only good for being domestic workers or construction workers. This problem must be addressed through education, economic development and access to fundamental rights.

" Ecuador’s former public radio chief fabricated sexual abuse charges against the Colombian victim of the powerful family’s violence after demanding custody of her child.The sons of former media executive Giovanna Tassi physically abused Carolina Garcia between 2012 and 2017, according to records in the hands of the prosecution and a domestic violence court.Tassi hired a questionable psychological evaluation firm in 2018 that implied Garcia physically abused her child while minimizing the family’s violence and abuse against the Colombian woman.Tassi pressured the agency against domestic violence, the Rights Protection Board, to order Garcia’s participation in the evaluation paid for by her victimizers’ mother.As if that wasn’t sinister enough, the former radio chief invented claims that the Colombian women could be sexually abusing her child in 2019 after Garcia demanded the return of her child.The unsubstantiated sexual abuse claim backfired as it triggered a criminal investigation, which has yet to find any confirmation that the Tassi family victim was abusing her own child.Instead, the evaluation reports summoned by prosecutors and found they were riddled with false claims, and indicated that Tassi has been subjecting her son’s victim to what could be psychological torture in collusion with the anti-abuse agency.The records demonstrate how the agency refused to admit photographic evidence of furniture destroyed by Garcia’s former boyfriend, Arau Viteri, and refused to let the victim defend herself against Tassi’s attempts to take her child.The evidence also shows the despair of Garcia’s former public defender about the board’s refusal to consider evidence her client had been the victim of years of abuse while validating the unsubstantiated claims of the psychologists paid by Tassi as fact.According to Ecuador’s former public radio chief, the evidence indicating Tassi may be masterminding a criminal conspiracy would be evidence that her family’s victim “is trying to confuse the judicial authority.”The anti-abuse agency has so far refused to revoke its decision that put Garcia’s child in the care of her victimizers’ mother.Ecuador’s prosecution doesn’t have the authority to overturn this possibly fraudulent decision and has failed to file criminal charges against either Tassi and her sons for their alleged abuse and corruption.

" The mayor of Bogota announced Colombia’s capital will go on lockdown as one of multiple measures to prevent that a surge in COVID-19 infections collapse the city’s hospitals.In a speech, Mayor Claudia Lopez said Monday that authorities will additionally impose mobility restrictions during the week.Unlike the long weekend lockdown, the mobility restrictions allow people to go to work, but restrict the entry of public offices and commercial establishments.The measures in Bogota are part of a number of measures taken by national and local authorities to curb a recent surge in infections.Coronavirus infections and deathsHealth Minister Fernando Ruiz, for example, said Monday that travelers will only be allowed to board flights into and inside Colombia if they can show negative coronavirus test results.In major cities like Medellin and Barranquilla, where hospitals are all but saturated, a curfew that was put in place ahead of Holy Week has been extended.Health authorities throughout Colombia are struggling to deal with the surge in infections while trying to execute President Ivan Duque’s National Vaccination Plan.The most ambitious vaccination drive in history is being hindered by failures in the distribution and application of vaccine shots to healthcare workers and people of 60 and older.National Vaccination Plan progressDuque and Ruiz have promised to vaccinate 35 million of Colombia’s 50 million inhabitants before the end of the year, a target they are increasingly unlikely to meet.Particularly in rural areas, private healthcare intermediaries have had trouble reaching out to elderly citizens and facilitate their vaccination.Consequently, doctors and nurses have only been able to apply a fraction of the vaccine shots needed to meet the government’s target.Healthcare organizations have been calling on the government not to include the notoriously corrupt intermediaries in the National Vaccination Plan.

" Colombia’s prosecution said Wednesday that it would open a criminal investigation against a leading opposition candidate in next year’s presidential election.Former Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo and other leading opposition politicians dismissed the corruption allegations of the Prosecutor General’s Office, which is led by one of President Ivan Duque’s best friends.In a press release, the prosecution said Fajardo allegedly broke the law in 2013 when the politician signed off on a $77 million loan as governor of his native Antioquia province.This loan turned out to be more expensive than anticipated after a 2014 drop in global commodity prices sunk the value of the peso against the dollar.The criminal investigation was met with skepticism by both allies and rivals of Fajardo, who was already being investigated by Comptroller General Luis Felipe Cordoba, one of the best friends of chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa.Colombia’s comptroller general holds politicians responsible for $1B dam debacle“It doesn’t sound good that months before a presidential election the prosecution gets involved,” said opposition Senator Gustavo Petro, Fajardo’s main rival in the election race.Experts expressed their surprise against political news website La Silla Vacia about the prosecution’s criminal charges over the increased cost of the loan that the central bank also didn’t foresee.Barbosa has lost much of his credibility as a consequence of questionable decisions made by the prosecution since Duque’s long-time friend was elected Prosecutor General last year.The prosecution has gone to lengths to drop a criminal investigation against former President Alvaro Uribe, the president’s political patron and accused of fraud and bribery by the Supreme Court.Duque critic Claudia Lopez, the mayor of Bogota has been the subject of a criminal investigation for walking her dog in violation of a curfew put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus.The apparent politicization of the prosecution under Barbosa has further eroded public confidence in the justice system, which was already low because of the alleged corruption of the chief prosecutor’s predecessors. 2022 electionsAntioquiaProsecutor General's Officesergio fajardo ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-prosecution-opens-investigation-against-opposition-presidential-candidate/,Colombia’s prosecution opens investigation against opposition presidential candidate
" Colombia’s justice minister on Tuesday stripped the judicial branch of powers that force the increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque to abide by the law.Only Congress is allowed to legislate on the judicial branch’s powers within the boundaries of the constitution, but that didn’t stop Justice Minister Wilson Ruiz.The minister issued a decree that removed administrative courts’ power that limit the president’s ability to execute policies that break the law or violate citizens’ rights.Colombia’s judicial system has been a major headache for Duque, who studied law but apparently has difficulty governing without engaging in illegal activity.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersThe administrative courts allow citizens to sue the government and block the execution of policies if they are illegal or violate their rights.Duque has been trying to resume the aerial spraying of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, but has been unable to do so in compliance with strict conditions imposed by the Constitutional Court.Ruiz apparently believes the president would be able to execute his counternarcotics policy and other policies deemed matters of “national security” without legal constraints.The ties between Colombia’s government and organized crimeAccording to the Justice Ministry decree, only the Council of State would have the authority to stop the president if Duque wishes to ignore the law of citizens’ rights.Ruiz told newspaper El Espectador that the president “among other obligations, is responsible for the preservation of public order throughout the national territory.”In order for the president to fulfill this obligation, the Justice Minister decided to change the law to “reinforce the decentralization of the administration of justice, preserve the functional hierarchy, and guarantee the unification of jurisprudence and the general interest,” Ruiz told the newspaper.Unfortunately for the minister, “that’s unconstitutional,” according to a source within the top of the justice system and his government “can’t be trusted,” according to another senior justice official.You can’t blame a man for trying though, especially when Duque is close to going into history as “Colombia’s worst president ever.” Ivan DuqueWilson Ruiz ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-strips-courts-of-powers-that-block-duques-authoritarian-ambitions/,Colombia strips courts of powers that block Duque’s authoritarian ambitions

" The coronavirus aggravated the impact of armed conflict on civilians in Colombia last year, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).During the presentation of the humanitarian organization’s annual report, representative Lorenzo Caraffi said Wednesday that fighting between the military and illegal armed groups further deteriorated the situation of civilians.The armed conflicts aggravated the situation of civilians who found themselves increasingly unable to avoid being victimized by the violence in the months that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in Colombia.The COVID-19 pandemic has plunged communities living in areas affected by violence into even greater fear than they were already experiencing, not only because of the presence of a virus that has affected thousands of families, but also because of the implication of being unprotected in the midst of armed conflicts that seem to worsen as the months go by.International Committee of the Red CrossAccording to the ICRC, the victimization of civilians by the armed conflicts between the military and illegal armed groups continued to be concentrated in five of Colombia’s 32 provinces.These provinces continued to suffer the consequences of five armed conflicts that continued after the demobilization of former guerrilla group FARC that followed a 2016 peace deal with former President Juan Manuel Santos.The Pacific coast found itself engulfed in armed conflict that triggered the mass displacement of the more than 21,307 people and impeded the freedom of movement of some 28,123 people.The northeastern Norte de Santander province registered most landmine victims, a phenomenon that left 389 victims, the highest number in four years, throughout Colombia.Armed conflict victims in 2020 The ICRC additionally raised the alarm about the ongoing forced disappearance of civilians of which the humanitarian organization registered 571 victims since the beginning of the peace process in late 2016.The pandemic severely limited the families of missing persons to look for their loved ones, according to the ICRC.The humanitarian organization urged the government of far-right President Ivan Duque to regulate the use of state force in its attempts to combat illegal armed groups to prevent victimizing the civilian population.Duque has been reluctant to implement the FARC peace deal and has been trying to increase military involvement in its attempt to combat drug trafficking.The government has consistently tried to minimize the impact on civilians of its failing public public security and peace policies. armed conflictICRCnewslettervictims ",https://colombiareports.com/covid-19-pandemic-aggravated-impact-of-armed-conflict-in-colombia/,‘COVID-19 pandemic aggravated impact of armed conflict in Colombia’
" No coffee farmer in Colombia is allowed to export coffee without paying the mighty coffee federation, historically one of the main promoters of fascist economics.Coffee federation Fedecafe was founded in 1927, inspired by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini’s “corporatism” model, which rejected free market capitalism and the central planning of the Soviet Union’s Joseph Stalin.From Rome to BogotaThe holy trinity“Corporatism” was originally invented by the Catholic Church in the late 19th Century to counter capitalism with a neo-feudal economic model that sought to maintain a medieval class system.Mussolini adopted the idea to create corporations that controlled the different sectors of the economy in coordination with the State and the Catholic Church.This fascist economic model became the blueprint for Nazi Germany’s National Socialism and Colombia’s economic policy that relied heavily on coffee exports.Two year after the creation of Fedecafe, the national government gave the federation control over the government’s National Coffee Fund (FNC).By funneling public funds to the federation’s FNC, the coffee growers and the Church were able to control the economy and maintain order in coffee-growing regions where the government had virtually no control.Fedecafe opened its first office in New York City in 1930 to promote the sale of Colombia’s main export product in the world’s biggest and most competitive consumption market.Social and state corporatismLate President Laureano GomezAt home, the coffee federation and “similarly organized structures” were “auxiliary bodies dependent on the State” that used government funds to create “parastates,” according to historians.Consequently, “the legitimacy and functioning of the State basically or exclusively depended on the activity of non-competitive, hierarchically ordered corporations” representing a single agricultural sectors like coffee.The defeat of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy ended corporatism in northern Europe, which was divided in a capitalist west and a communist east.Colombia’s Conservative Party and corporations like Fedecafe refused to renounce fascism and — with the support of the Catholic Church — continued to reject both capitalism and communism.In the face of the painful and desolate outlook presented by the post-war period, the corporatist idea — the sole source of charity and virtue — will be the bulwark to which nations will turn for their final reintegration. The world will understand by force that hatred neither constructs nor redeems, but that love is the call to reconcile people’s will and direct men’s powers well. The corporatist idea shows itself in the current circumstances as the north star that will guide our destiny to a higher goal!Fascist ideologist Francisco Cajiao (1946)The fascist model was fiercely opposed by Liberal Party reformists who wanted a more democratic society and economists who wanted Colombia’s capitalists to adopt free market principles.Thus an order arises which, in the absence of corporate organizations with competing interests, would give national capitalism a rigidly oligarchic form.Economist Antonio Garcia (1948)The failed corporatist StateTensions exploded after founding Fedecafe director Mariano Ospina became president in 1946 and Liberal Party leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was assassinated in 1948.The murder triggered a civil war between the Conservative Party and business associations like Fedecafe that controlled the government and much of the economy on one side, and liberals and socialists on the other.Ospina’s successor, Laureano Gomez, proposed the creation of a “Corporatist Social State” in 1952, but a 1953 military coup led by General Gustavo Rojas shattered the fascist politician’s dream.Rojas’ achieved to end the partisan bloodbath in 1958, but failed to fortify the weakened State that increasingly relied on Fedecafe to quell opposition against “the oligarchy.”All the while, the federation maintained its monopoly as sole trader of all Colombian coffee at what Fedecafe called “a fair and transparent price that is based on current international prices.”Exporting Colombia’s corporatismUnder the leadership of Medellin oligarch Arturo Gomez, the coffee federation created the brand “Juan Valdez” in 1960 to promote its coffee in the United States.Colombia’s coffee growers were starving, but Fedecafe controlled the entire supply chain and was able to publish a number of fancy ads in the New York Times.The International Coffee Organization (ICO) regulated international coffee prices two years later, eliminating free trade in coffee worldwide.A 1975 crisis in Brazil saw Fedecafe’s income boom, which caused tensions with late President Alfonzo Lopez who wanted to use the increased export revenue to develop the national economy.Lopez’ socioeconomic policy adviser at the time, Jorge Cardenas, succeeded Gomez in 1982 after the election of conservative President Belisario Betancur.Cardenas didn’t know anything about coffee, but the federation bosses were reportedly pleased with how the former presidential adviser defended their private interests while being paid to advise on public policy.A man who had never owned a coffee farm, much less planted a single coffee plant, became a key player in the Federation to the point that when the time came for the transition in 1982, Belisario Betancur — with the support and consensus of the sector — found it easy to appoint the new CEO, who was also his friend of many years.Newspaper El TiempoThe Comptroller General of the Republic quickly found that Fedecafe was spending the government’s FNC funds with “a high degree of inefficiency and low profitability,” but was ignored.This became a major problem in 1989 when the ICO was forced to end its price fixing practices despite fierce international lobbying by Gomez and former President Cesar Gaviria.Global coffee prices dropped and Colombia’s coffee farmers plunged in a crisis, yet Fedecafe refused to loosen its absolute control over the production and export process.In 1995, the federation introduced its Specialty Coffee Program, which banned the trade in coffee that didn’t meet the quality standard set by Fedecafe.Gomez was able to use his influence in Bogota to barter increased government subsidies with former President Andres Pastrana’s finance Minister, Juan Manuel Santos.The federation used the subsidy to compete with capitalist corporations like Starbucks that was now also allowed to sell Colombian coffee, but failed.Gomez resigned in 2002, leaving the coffee sector in one of its worst crises ever.Federation’s role bashed by economistsSantos became president in 2010 and appointed two former Fedecafe CEO’s to lead the Defense Ministry. Mauricio Cardenas, the son of the federation’s long-time CEO, became finance minister in 2012.An independent economic commission urged to end the federation’s totalitarian grip on the coffee sector in 2014, claiming Fedecafe’s monopoly was corrupting free trade. There is an agent that is at the same time a competitor, policy designer and market regulator, that does not face the same level of risk in its business decisions as its competitors, because it is protected by public resources (from our taxes), and does not face the same tax obligations as its competitors.Mission for the Competitiveness of CoffeeAfter initial fierce resistance, Cardenas was able to convince the federation to agree to “the most profound and far-reaching reform in decades” in 2015.This reform lifted the federation’s ban on the trade of lower-quality coffee and allowed producers to export coffee as long as they payed taxes to Fedecafe.And the treasury continues to leakColombia’s farmers were not allowed to sell their coffee abroad with the “Cafe de Colombia” brand unless they paid an extra annual free to the coffee federation.In return, Fedecafe agreed to come up with “initiatives that generate income and development opportunities” for coffee growers who agreed to continue selling their coffee to the federation.The Agriculture Ministry allocated Fedecafe $2.7 billion (COP10 billion) from the National Budget to the FNC, which the federation continued to manage.Santos extended the coffee federation’s control over the FNC by another 10 years in 2018 and granted Fedecafe another $2.1 million one month before leaving office.The coffee federation was still not able to compete on the international market. Fedecafe couldn’t even compete against foreign coffee producers who came to dominate domestic consumption.Internationally, the coffee federation claims to be “democratic,” which it is not, and claimed to represent coffee growers who are not allowed to join the organization and growing “illegal” coffee.Fedecafe said in 2018 that it represented 540,000 coffee growers. Some 215,000 of these farmers, however, were banned from doing business with the federation because they didn’t own land.Our work is dedicated to the highest values, ethical principles and international standards; we have an organizational culture with a high vocation of service to the coffee growers of our country. Our governance model, policies, standards and procedures allow us to be an organization recognized for its transparent actions and its commitment to generate value for its different stakeholders.FedecafeNotwithstanding, the coffee federation was awarded a “Leadership Medal of Merit” by the Coffee Quality Institute and a “Sustainability Award” by the Specialty Coffee Association in 2018.To add insult to injury, Fedecafe received a “Sustainable Standard-Setters Award” from environmental organization Rainforest Alliance in 2019.The federation said last year that it had spent $80 million in “public good and services” from the public funds that CEO Roberto Velez claimed to be Fedecafe’s funds. coffeeNational Federation of Coffee Growers ",https://colombiareports.com/the-role-of-fascism-in-colombia-part-1-the-coffee-corporatists/,The role of fascism in Colombia | Part 1: the coffee corporatists
" Thirty years after demobilizing with rebel group M-19, opposition Senator Gustavo Petro is Colombia’s favorite in the 2022 presidential election race.The chances the Colombia’s voters will make history and elect the former member of a guerrilla group as president seem bigger than ever.Petro lost the second round of the 2018 elections to President Ivan Duque after being dubbed the favorite in 2017, but considerably less support the progressive has now, according to polls.Opposition leader favorite as countdown to Colombia’s 2022 elections beginsPetro’s impressive leadAccording to a poll released by weekly Semana earlier this week, the opposition Senator can count on the support of 23%, which is almost double the support of former Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo.Petro’s “extreme centrist” opponents can count on the support of 12% of voters and is followed by Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez who has the support of 9%, according to Semana.The Semana poll confirmed a poll held by Datexco earlier this month that also gave Petro a convincing lead over his political rivals.Semana poll What has changed since 2017?The former rebel and former mayor of Bogota also kicked off the 2018 election race, but considerably less convincing that this year.In Datexco’s February 2017 poll, Petro’s 12.9% initial lead was tight with Fajardo at 12.3% and former Vice-President German Vargas at 9.8%.Duque didn’t enter the race until late 2017 and defeated his opposition rival, but has squandered public support for his administration since his election and could go into history as Colombia’s president ever.The runner-up in the 2018 elections additionally is favored by the changing demographic profile of Colombia’s voters.For the first time in history, the majority of the population that is eligible to vote received public education instead of education that was controlled by the Catholic Church.Additionally, next year’s elections will see the participation of a generation of new voters who were spared the peak in guerrilla and paramilitary violence that battered Colombia in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s.Contrary to many old voters, younger generations seem hardly offended by Petro’s participation in the insurgency of the M-19, which demobilized in 1990.Instead, a growing number a voters seem increasingly fed up with corruption and the fear-mongering of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party.The coalition formed around Fajardo has additionally agreed to refrain from stigmatizing the leading candidate’s coalition of student organizations, labor unions and ethnic minority groups.The dilemma of Colombia’s ‘Coalition of Hope’Have Colombia’s traditional power houses collapsed?Colombia’s elections were historically determined by two political parties, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, with the support of the “clans” of political dynasties and regional electoral barons.The traditional parties and clans were instrumental in securing Duque’s victory in 2018 when they put their weight behind the protégé of far-right former President Alvaro Uribe.These political powerhouses largely failed in the 2019 local elections that saw progressive anti-corruption candidates take power in the capital Bogota, and major cities like Medellin and Cali.This is impeding the abuse of power to support candidates in next year’s presidential and congressional in Colombia’s biggest cities significantly more difficult.The president and National Registrar Alexander Vega have been trying to ramp up budgets of regional allies amid concerns these funds could be used for illegal electoral purposes.A failed attempt to postpone the elections earlier this month indicates that the traditional powerhouses are anything but confident about their ability to determine next year’s vote.Meanwhile, Petro’s allies have expressed confidence they can make history and — with the support of Fajardo’s coalition — secure the first-ever victory of a former guerrilla in a presidential election.Colombia’s electoral barons join forces ahead of 2022 elections 2022 electionsGustavo PetroM-19 ",https://colombiareports.com/gustavo-petro-from-rebel-to-colombias-next-president/,Gustavo Petro: from rebel to Colombia’s next president?
" Colombia’s government seeks an increase in tax revenue of at least $10B to finance its budget and help the poor to overcome the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The “Sustainable Solidarity” tax reform Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla will present to Congress on Wednesday seeks to increase revenue by increasing sales tax on specific products, and increase wealth, income and dividend taxes.The tax hikes seek to increase the government’s revenue with at least $10 billion (between COP36 trillion and COP42 trillion) and increase spending on the poor.In order to reduce poverty, which affects more than 40% of the country, increased funds will be allocated to extend the government’s Solidary Income Program that came to life last year. This $45 monthly stipend would be granted to 4.7 million instead of 3 million recipients.The government additionally plans to sponsor higher education of some 720,000 poor high-school graduates and pay social security benefits of some 500,000 people, specifically young employees, people with a disability and women of 40 and older.Recipients of the monthly stipend would additionally receive a monthly tax sales return of $12,50 (COP45,000), according to local media.This increase seeks to compensate the poor for the removal of the 5% sales tax rate on products that will fall under the 19% rate.The administration of President Ivan Duque believes this would allow an estimated tax revenue increase of almost $3 billion (COP10.5 trillion), according to local media.The government additionally seeks to lower the threshold for income tax from $900 (COP3.2 million) to $700 (COP2.5 million) and end income tax extensions.This would allow tax agency DIAN to generate an additional $4.5 billion (COP16 trillion) in revenue.The country’s wealth tax rate, which will be deductible from income tax, will go from 1% to 3%.The government seeks to freezing the salaries of government employees for a period of five years, which would allow to cut public spending by $3 billion (COP10.5 trillion).

" Colombia’s prosecution bungled the interrogation of an extradited drug trafficker whose allegedly fabricated testimony justified fraud and bribery charges against former President Alvaro Uribe.An assistant of controversial prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes interrogated Juan Carlos Sierra, a.k.a. “El Tuso,” in an absurd video conference with the former narco, who currently lives in Miami.The attorney of Senator Ivan Cepeda, the victim of Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery practices, was unable to sit in due to apparent connection problems.Colombia ‘harassing victim and witness’ of former president’s alleged criminal practicesHow to avoid incriminating evidenceEl Tuso confirmed he was asked to provide written testimonies by Uribe’s former fixer, Diego Cadena, and former CIA agent Lisa Ruth.The assistant prosecutor failed to inquire about the veracity of the second testimony, which was allegedly dictated by Uribe and written by Cadena, according to the Supreme Court.The former drug trafficker declined to testify before the high court in 2019 to either confirm or deny he had written the testimony in which former chief prosecutor Eduardo Montealegre was accused of conspiring against the former president.El Tuso did agree to talk to the assistant prosecutor, who avoided the incriminating evidence against the former president and seemed unaware of the 40-year conviction also the former drug trafficker didn’t recall.Instead, the two talked about a 2009 visit of Cepeda and two other lawmakers to the drug trafficker’s United States prison as part of an investigation into ties between demobilized paramilitary organization AUC, government officials and the private sector.Uribe witness retracts testimony defending Colombia’s former presidentThe Uribe family’s narco friendUribe frustrated these investigations in 2008 after the demobilized paramilitaries and drug traffickers collaboration with justice began spilling the beans on their contacts, including the former president’s cousin who was a close friend of El Tuso.According to the narco, the former president’s cousin did not mediate this time.Instead, El Tuso said he was asked for help after a talk with the brother of extradited Medellin crime boss “Rogelio,” who said he contacted Democratic Center deputy Roque Arismendi.The deputy and Uribe’s son Tomas respectively called in the help of Uribe’s fixer and the former CIA agent to contact the former drug trafficker, who said he learned he was expected to testify in court via television.Lisa Ruth, Juan Manuel Aguilar, Roque Arismendi and Tomas UribeThe final weeks?The prosecution is seeking court permission to drop the investigation against Uribe after failed attempts to revoke the indictment and exclude evidence collected by the Supreme Court since the beginning of 2018.Jaimes received the case in August last year after Uribe resigned from the Senate in order to end the investigation of the high court, which had placed the former president under house arrest.The hearing in which the prosecutor will seek to drop the investigation before a Bogota judge is set for April 6.The former president’s victims announced criminal charges against Jaimes over his allegedly criminal attempts to sink the investigation.Colombia’s prosecution facing criminal charges over Uribe probe Alvaro UribeEl TusoProsecutor General's OfficeUribe trial ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-prosecution-fails-to-inquire-about-allegedly-fake-testimony-in-uribe-trial/,Colombia’s prosecution fails to inquire about allegedly fake testimony in Uribe trial

" Colombia’s prosecution arbitrarily arrested a key witness in the case against former President Alvaro Uribe’s brother on charges after their statute of limitations passed.The prosecution was forced to release former Police Major Juan Carlos Meneses on Friday, two days after the former official was illegally detained in the eastern city of Cucuta.According to Meneses’ defense attorney, the arbitrary arrest was a retaliation for the former police official’s cooperation in the investigation against Uribe’s brother Santiago, who allegedly led death squads in their native Antioquia province in the 1990s.The arrest of the key witness is the latest abuse of power of the Prosecutor General’s Office, which is seeking impunity for the former president who was charged with fraud and bribery by the Supreme Court.In February, a judge ordered the release of two police investigators who discovered the former president’s Democratic Center party conspired to rig the 2018 elections in favor of President Ivan Duque.According to the court, the investigators were the victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa, whose late money launderer helped the president get elected.Court revokes detention of cops who discovered Colombia’s 2018 election fraud plotKeeping the Uribe brothers out of prisonThe arbitrary arrests have further eroded the credibility of the prosecution and Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, one of Duque’s best friends.Following Barbosa’s election last year, the chief prosecutor’s subordinates have gone to lengths to prevent investigations against the former president and his younger brother.Uribe’s older brother, Jaime Alberto, had two children with a former cartel trafficker but died in 2001 before any possible criminal activity could be investigated.The prosecution asked the court earlier this month to drop an investigation into the former president’s alleged fraud and bribery practices that apparently sought to frustrate investigations into mounting evidence of his family’s criminal activity.The prosecution and the Uribe family’s defense attorney have been trying to sink two criminal investigations against the former president and one against his brother after Uribe resigned from the Senate in August last year.The investigation into the former president’s allegedly lead role in the 2018 election fraud scandal continues to be investigated by the Supreme Court.Apart from the fraud and bribery charges, the prosecution is supposed to be investigating Uribe alleged complicity in three paramilitary massacres and a homicide between 1996 and 1998.The prosecution is also supposed to be investigating a homicide carried out by the “12 Apostles,” a death squad allegedly founded by the former president’s brother when the Medellin Cartel began disintegrating in 1992.Both have been accused of founding the “Bloque Metro” paramilitary group with the Uribe family’s former cartel associates in 1996.Testimony: how group on US terror list helped Uribe win Colombia’s 2002 electionsA decade of prosecution failuresMore than 20 former members of the now-defunct AUC have testified over the Uribe brothers’ alleged ties to the now-defunct paramilitary organization since 2011.Multiple of these witnesses have been assassinated while the prosecution failed to investigate their testimonies and corroborating evidence.The prosecution got actively involved in the former president’s alleged attempts to obstruct justice amid mounting pressure by the Supreme Court and the Medellin Superior Tribunal, which ordered a criminal investigation against Uribe in 2016 already.The investigations are fiercely opposed by the former president’s political party, which helped one of Escobar’s cousins and the daughter of one of the late drug lord’s money launderers get elected to Colombia’s Senate.Colombia’s prosecution facing criminal charges over Uribe probe Alvaro UribeJuan Carlos MenesesProsecutor General's OfficeSantiago Uribe ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-arrests-key-witness-in-latest-attempt-to-frustrate-uribe-investigations/,Colombia illegally jails key witness in Uribe family investigation
" Colombia’s opposition called for protests on Wednesday to halt attempts by the coalition of far-right President Ivan Duque to postpone elections.Leading opposition lawmakers called on their constituencies to take to the streets to an alleged coalition attempt to lobby support to postpone the elections until 2022.Duque publicly said to step down in August next year, but his far-right Democratic Center party has been rallying support to postpone the vote, opposition House Representative Katherine Miranda said Wednesday.The proposal to postpone the elections and let them coincide with local elections was initially coined by Gilberto Toro, the president of the National Federation of Municipalities.Toro’s proposal has been made multiple times before and was dismissed until Miranda (Green Alliance) found lawmakers were lobbying support to present a constitutional amendment that would allow an extension of Duque’s term.According to the representative, this amendment would weaken the checks and balances of power provided by the constitution. “It’s a coup!” the representative tweeted.Congress cannot take away the sovereignty of the people and expand its mandate without asking the citizens. House Representative Katherine MirandaThe centrist representative called on her constituents to take to the street, which was supported by opposition Senator Gustavo Petro, who plans to run for president next year.“They are preparing to stage a coup,” Petro tweeted, adding that “this isn’t only countered in Congress.

" Some of Colombia’s most powerful electoral barons have formed a coalition that seeks to confront progressive candidates in the 2022 elections.The coalition of the former governors and mayors is the result of lobbying of former Barranquilla Mayor Alejandro Char, who wants to become president next year.The notoriously corrupt Char Clan received the support from six other political clans that jointly seek to become “a voice from the regions.”The clans are close to the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the U Party and Radical Change, but are not formally endorsed by their parties.The coalition said Friday that it sought to be working on a joint political agenda that sought to support Colombia’s ongoing peace process and a decentralization of power.The ‘clans’: the criminal forces rigging Colombia’s economy and democracyPotential additionsChar talked about a possible coalition with former Bogota Mayor Enrique Peñalosa and former Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez earlier this month, but left them out of the coalition that was announced on Friday.Barranquilla’s former mayor reportedly also talked with former President Alvaro Uribe, the boss of President Ivan Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party, but so far without results.Regional clan coalitionPowerful allianceThe center-right alliance bundles the forces of powerful electoral barons from some of Colombia’s biggest cities who have proven to be able to mobilize large numbers of voters in their native provinces.This power would be strengthened if the coalition receives the informal support of the members’ political parties that have national networks that could be employed for campaigning.The coalition is a force to be reckoned with by presidential hopefuls Gustavo Petro and Sergio Fajardo who have been forming coalitions with progressive political allies and social organizations.The clans’ support was essential for Duque’s 2018 election victory and helped the president form a majority coalition in Congress.The president’s bosses | Part 2: Colombia’s clansControversies guaranteedWithout exception, the members of the center-right coalition have been associated with corruption or organized crime, which could weaken their candidate’s chances next year.Char’s brother Arturo, the current president of the Senate, is being investigated by the Supreme Court over his clan’s alleged election fraud in 2018, which could severely disrupt the coalition’s campaign.Public opinion has increasingly turned against politicians associated with corruption, which boosted support for both Petro and Fajardo in 2018 and is likely to help the progressives in the 2022 campaign. 2022 electionsnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-electoral-barons-join-forces-ahead-of-2022-elections/,Colombia’s electoral barons join forces ahead of 2022 elections
" A rookie congresswoman triggered an overwhelming social media response in Colombia that ended an attempted “coup” that sought to postpone next year’s elections on Thursday.Opposition House Representative Katherine Miranda (Green Alliance) called on her constituents tot take to the streets after learning that members of the coalition were trying to propose a bill that sought to postpone next year’s elections.Miranda’s alerts triggered a revolt on social media that forced most of the supporters of the bill to withdraw their support for the plan to extend the terms of President Ivan Duque, Congress, watchdog entities and even the high courts.The alleged coup attempt alarmed experts and opposition lawmakers who warned that the impending threat to prevent free and and fair elections next year is far from being thwarted.There’s a deliberate attempt by we don’t know who, but their purpose is malevolent… There exists the intention to mock the Colombian people, to thwart their sovereignty, to violate the 1991 constitution and to establish power for who knows how long.Former Constitutional Court president Jose Gregorio HernandezColombia’s opposition calls for protests against attempted ‘coup’Who is behind the ‘coup’ attempt and why?The failed bill was being promoted by some 20 relatively unknown house representatives from the coalition of President Ivan Duque and the independent Liberal Party.The bill sought to extend the terms of almost all sitting officials through a constitutional amendment that was not formally endorsed by the coalition parties.Miranda, opposition Senator Gustavo Bolivar, former Constitutional Court president Jose Gregorio Hernandez and political scientist Catalina Botero said to have no doubt the “coup” was informally backed by senior politicians and possibly the government in an online debate organized by journalist Maria Jimena Duzan.The president and his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, rejected the bill after the social media revolt. The coalition parties of those promoting the constitutional reform remained quiet.According to Botero, she was approached by two coalition members who expressed their concern about the initiative that was being discussed within their party more than a month ago.This was planned and organized with goals.

" The administration of Colombia’s president Ivan Duque bribed lawmakers to support postponing next year’s elections, according to senators.According to independent Senator Rodrigo Lara, government officials offered funds meant for the country’s peace process to lawmakers who agreed to support last week’s failed “coup.”Colombia’s opposition calls for protests against attempted ‘coup’The timeline of the first “coup” attemptSenator Luis Fernando VelascoThe president of the National Federation of Municipalities, Gilberto Toro, proposed to postpone the national elections so they would coincide with local elections in 2023 last month.The proposal was dismissed until Senator Luis Fernando Velasco (Liberal Party) raised the alarm on March 10, claiming the government would be bribing lawmakers into proposing a constitutional amendment.Velasco said on Twitter that “I am told that high-level government officials are calling them to grease palms.”I do not want to believe that the President of the Republic is behind this, so I want to specifically invite him or the Interior Minister to come out and stop this barbarity. You cannot go and discard the sovereignty of the people, and with the vote of congressmen extend certain periods without asking the citizens.Senator Luis Fernando VelascoDuque said he was not interested in serving more time earlier last week. Nevertheless, house representatives raised the alarm again after noticing that the proposal to amend the constitution was circulating in the lower chamber.According to Lara, the government offered lawmakers who would support the “coup” slush funds taken from social investment budgets meant for so-called PDET regions.These war-torn regions are supposed to receive increased investment as part of a 2016 peace agreement between former President Juan Manuel Santos and former guerrilla group FARC.To collect these signatures they are offering slush funds. And the worst kind. They are taking the resources of the PDET (from the poorest areas affected by violence) to offer them to the congressmen who sign this savage coup.Senator Rodrigo LaraRookie lawmaker triggers social media revolt in Colombia to squash ‘coup’ attemptThe president told investors last year that he would “advance the investments” in PDET regions that were “expected between the year 2021 and 2030.”Investors want to see democratic and institutional stability, and Colombia has it.President Ivan DuqueSecond attempt to change election dateHouse Representative Alejandro ChaconThe bill triggered a wave of indignation and 15 of the 22 representatives who initially signed off on the bill to vote on the constitutional amendment backed away.Within 48 hours, however, former House president Alejandro Chacon presented a second proposal to amend the constitution.This “transitory” constitutional amendment sought to hold the first round of the presidential election on the same day as the congressional elections in March instead of separately in May.This proposal would be “the dream” of the “clientelists” and other corrupt politicians, who would be able to corrupt the outcome of two elections buying votes for one, according to political scientist Cesar Caballero.The proposal would additionally make opposition primaries impossible, according to House Representative Katherine Miranda.The second proposal was made public around the time that electoral barons of notoriously corrupt “clans” announced they would form a coalition to counter opposition attempts to win the elections.Colombia’s electoral barons join forces ahead of 2022 elections 2022 electionselection fraudnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/government-behind-coup-that-sought-to-postpone-colombias-elections-senators/,Colombia’s government promised peace funds to ‘grease palms’ for ‘coup’
" China’s President Xi Jinping stressed his government’s strengthening ties in Colombia on Saturday amid tensions between US President Joe Biden and his counterparts in Beijing and Bogota.President Ivan Duque published a message from the leader of China’s Communist Party on his website after announcing the arrival of another shipment of the COVID-19 vaccines produced in the Asian country.In Xi’s message to Duque and his “Colombian friends,” Xi stressed the “deep friendship between the peoples of the Asian and the South American countries.The Chinese president also praised the efforts of his Colombian counterpart to strengthen trade ties with the Asian country and the recent cooperation to combat the coronavirus with the Sinovac vaccine, which is produced in Beijing.In the face of the economic difficulties caused by the sudden appearance of covid-19, China and Colombia showed solidarity and deployed active anti-epidemic cooperation.Chinese President Xi JinpingXi’s charm offensive comes as relations between Bogota and Washington DC are strained by meddling in last year’s elections in the US by Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party.The US president has yet to personally talk with his Colombian counterpart, which is highly uncommon as the two countries’ governments have been staunch allies for decades.Relations between the US Government and Xi’s authoritarian regime have also severely worsened after former US President Donald Trump left office earlier this year.The far-right Duque and China’s communist government have tried to strengthen trade relations since the Colombian president took office in 2018.Duque’s priority in China: money, not politicsThe improved relations have facilitated an increase in Chinese investment in Colombia where the Asian giant has become a major player in the development of infrastructure.Beijing’s coronavirus vaccines have been elementary for Duque’s COVID-19 vaccination strategy; more than 75% of the vaccines that have been delivered in the South American country so far are from the Asian country.Without the Sinovac deliveries, Colombia would only have received a little more than 700 thousand vaccine shots from private pharmaceutical firms a vaccine initiative led by the World Health Organization (WHO).

" Counterculture icon William S. Burroughs traveled to Colombia in 1953 to try ayahuasca, a drug that disappointed the writer almost as much as the capital Bogota.Most of Burroughs’ experiences were published in his 1963 novel The Yage Letters, a collection of correspondence between the legendary late writer and his former boyfriend and late poet Allen Ginsberg.Additional snippets of information were left by late botanist Paul Holliday, who joined Burroughs and biologist Richard Evan Shultes on their quest to the southern Putumayo province in early 1953.Burroughs’ had traveled to Bogota in 1951 already, hoping he would find the “final fix” in Ecuador but failed to try ayahuasca as he fell out with his travel partner, Lewis Marker.Burroughs, determined to try the relatively unknown drug, returned to Colombia in January 1953 and left the country less than two months later determined never to return.I remember an army officer in Puerto Leguizamo telling me: “Ninety percent of the people who come to Colombia never leave.” Let’s assume he meant that they fell for the charms of the place. I belong to the ten percent who will never return.William S. Burroughs“Bogota, horrible as always”In “The Yage Letters,” the beat generation icon was explicit about his dislike of Bogota during the most oppressive years of the Conservative Party, which was at war with the Liberal Party at the time.When Burroughs arrived in the capital, the author found himself in a virtual dictatorship that was strongly influenced by Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.In Bogota, more than in any other city I have visited in Latin America, you feel the dead weight of Spain, somber and oppressive. Everything official carried the “Made in Spain” seal.William S. BurroughsBurroughs had been deeply involved in creating one of the United States’ most influential countercultures of the 20th century, but Bogota’s youth wouldn’t be introduced to youth culture until after the author’s visit.Colombia’s countercultures: Bogota’s rock and roll gangsIn his letters to Ginsberg, the author did little to hide his disdain for the culture in Bogota, whose culture Burroughs seemed to perceive as mediocre and pretentious. Bogota is essentially a small town, everybody worried about what they are wearing and trying to look as if they hold a position of responsibility.William S. BurroughsThe violent animosity between the two parties did not go unnoticed to the writer.One night I was hiding in a liberal café when three conservative thugs in civilian clothes came in shouting “Long live the conservatives” hoping to provoke someone and kill him.William S. BurroughsBurroughs’ rejection of Bogota’s contemporary culture would be echoed in 1958 by a group of Medellin artists who began the “Nadaism” movement, Colombia’s first own counterculture.Colombia’s countercultures: From nothing to nadaism“Depressing” PutumayoThe writer traveled to Putumayo via Cali, Popayan and Pasto after Shultes had told Burroughs that ayahuasca was most easily found in the southern province where native Colombians used the drug in rituals.On the road, Burroughs would have his first run-ins the National Police and their “annoying and pointless” searches.Putumayo was by far the most depressing, according to the author as locals desperately seemed to hope that the Texas Oil Company would return “like the second coming of Christ,” according to Burroughs.The author found the southern province in a depression caused by a collapsed rubber boom, a rot that was killing cocoa harvests and poor soil that make agriculture barely worthwhile.Several times, when I was drunk, I told some people: “Look. There is no oil here. That’s why Texas quit. It’s never coming back. Do you understand?” But they couldn’t believe it.William S. BurroughsThe American biologist who would later become a main character in the film “Embrace of the Serpant” of Colombian filmmaker Ciro Guerra introduced Burroughs to his two shaman.AyahuascaHolliday would later remember that the author’s first ayahuasca trip was near Mocoa and prepared by a 70-year-old shaman.According to Burroughs, the shaman was getting drunk off the aguardiente the writer had brought. Both accounts agreed the writer spent most the evening vomiting.A shaman near Puerto Asis prepared ayahuasca following native Colombian traditions from the southeastern Vaupes province, which Burroughs describes as a considerably more pleasant experience.Burroughs ended up traveling all the way to Puerto Leguizamo where he got stuck while tensions between the locals and the foreign visitors rose to the point they were close to sparking violence.Puerto Leguizamo is named after a soldier who distinguished himself in the war with Peru in 1940. I asked one of the Colombians about it and he nodded: “Yes, Leguizamo was a soldier who did something in the war. “What did he do?” “Well, he did something.”William S. BurroughsTo make matters worse, Burroughs was arrested and thrown in jail because of a visa irregularity and wasn’t released until he got malaria.The author was ultimately able to get on a flight to Villavicencio and return to Bogota ill, he wrote Ginsberg.Burroughs swore never to return to Colombia but did convince Ginsberg, who traveled to Putumayo to try ayahuasca in 1960.By then, the Beat Generation was beginning to gain fame, mainly because of the poet’s epic poem “Howl,” and the now-classic novels “On the Road” by their friend Jack Kerouac and Burroughs’ “Naked Lunch.” ayahuascadrug useliterature ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-countercultures-the-beat-generations-bad-trip/,Colombia’s countercultures: the Beat Generation’s bad trip

" Colombia’s family welfare institute (ICBF) confirmed claims that illegal armed groups have recruited hundreds of children and teenagers during the peace process that began in late 2016.According to newspaper El Espectador, a recent ICBF report sent to the prosecution said the government was given custody over 465 underage victim of forced recruitment between November 2016 and January this year.The numbers correspond to 280 minors who had been recruited by guerrilla group ELN and 185 by other illegal armed groups.The ICBF report confirmed a November 2019 report by NGO Oxfam, which claimed that the recruitment of minors continued to be “widespread and systematic.”The NGO at the time said it had registered the recruitment of 311 minors since November 2016.Child recruitment in Colombia continues to be “widespread and systematic”How many missing children are known to authorities?The ICBF report only referred to rescued victims of the forced recruitment of minors as the forced recruitment of minors is grossly underreported.This became painfully clear after the death of a girl in the bombardment of an alleged camp of group former by dissident guerrillas of the now-defunct FARC group earlier this month.The father of the 16-year-old Danna Lizeth Montilla told media he believed his daughter was with her grandparents until he was informed by authorities she had been forcibly recruited and killed.Locals from around the location of the alleged FARC dissident camp in southern Colombia said 14 minors were missing and possibly in the hands of illegal armed groups.United Nations observers said in late 2019 it estimated that more than 600 minors were recruited by illegal armed groups since a peace deal between the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group and the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos.Colombia’s defense chief under fire over bombing minorsThe failing stateThe ICBF report indicated that the practice of child recruitment is particularly problematic in areas where multiple groups vie for control over territory or illegal activity like drug trafficking of illegal mining.Virtually all of these regions have historically suffered state neglect and high poverty rates.Areas where forced recruitment is most commonAccording to the ICBF, the agency took at least 6,944 minors into custody as part of its Specialized Attention program for rescued child soldiers since 1999.The Colombian agency in charge of recued victims of the forced recruitment is given custody when a victim of under 18.International Humanitarian Law considers the recruitment of anyone under the age of 14 a crime against humanity. child soldierschildrenforced recruitmenthuman rightsICBF ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-confirms-ongoing-recruitment-of-child-soldiers/,Colombia confirms ongoing recruitment of child soldiers
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque insisted on Wednesday that his country’s mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign is on schedule, contradicting even himself.In its daily report, the Health Ministry said Wednesday that more than 42,000 people have received vaccine shots in the previous 24 hours as authorities on all levels are ramping up vaccination efforts.The arrival of major shipments of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine increased pressure to secure the timely and safe distribution of the vaccines to regional health authorities that are in charge in applying the shots.Duque’s national vaccination planThe government’s National Vaccination Plan sought to provide protection against the coronavirus to 70% of Colombia’s 50 million inhabitants before the end of the year if all goes well.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said last month that health authorities had the capacity to apply “more than 100,000” shots a day and that “this vaccination capacity can increase.”Not everything is going well though as the “chaotic” vaccination and pharmaceutical companies’ difficulty to meet the global demand for vaccines are slowing down the process.On average, more than 236,000 people would have to receive a shot per day for the mass vaccination to be finished by the end of the year.“At the current speed,” however, the National Vaccination Plan would end “in five years, not before,” the president of the Colombian Medical Federation, Sergio Isaza, said Wednesday.Vaccination deliveriesVaccination progressNational Vaccination PlanContradictory promisesContradicting evidence, experts and himself, Duque said Wednesday that his strategy was going according to plan and that the target to finish the National Vaccination Plan before the end of the year would be met.The president said he hoped a million people of the priority group would received their first vaccine shot “before the end of this month” instead of securing their full immunity before March 17 as previously promised.Experts agreed the unprecedented mass vaccination plan has not been going as planned and expressed skepticism about Duque’s promise to vaccinate more than 37 million people before the end of the year.Clearly, the let’s say target will not be met unfortunately.Logistics expert Nelson MariñoWe are lagging behind and with great uncertainty about the arrival of vaccines.Public health expert Luis Jorge HernandezThe government has received fierce criticism over its response to the pandemic, its failure to fulfill promises and almost constant distorting of the truth since before the coronavirus was first confirmed in March last year.The pressure increased earlier this week after the first arrivals of major vaccine shipments from China that will have to be distributed throughout the country.The criticism on the president and the health minister has been amplified in Congress, which is preparing for elections in March next year.

" Colombia’s defense minister came under fire on Wednesday for calling underage victims of forced recruitment “war machines” in an attempt to justify bombing them.Defense Minister Diego Molano made the comment after journalist Hollman Morris revealed minors were killed in the bombing of an alleged camp of dissident FARC guerrillas in Calamar, a rural municipality in the southern Guaviare province, on March 2.Concern over missing minorsThe bombing caused concern in the region where locals said 14 minors are missing after presumably being forcibly recruited by dissident guerrillas of the the Southeastern Bloc.Colombia’s Medical Examiners confirmed it had received the remains of 10 people who allegedly died in the attack, but said it could not confirm the identities of those killed in the military attack.Medical examiners surrendered the remains of at least one girl who was killed in the bombing to her family.The late Danna Lizeth MontillaAccording to the father of the 16-year-old Danna Lizeth Montilla, his daughter disappeared in the middle of January, a month after she moved in with her grandparents whose internet connection allowed the girl to study.The family didn’t know the girl had been forcibly recruited by the guerrilla dissidents and was subsequently bombed to death by the military after they were told where to pick up her remains, the victim’s father, John Albert Montilla, told newspaper El Tiempo.They told me that the girl is without her right hand and without a leg, and that’s how they handed over the body to me.John Albert MontillaThe news of the bombing of the victims of forced recruitment triggered a wave of indignation throughout Colombia and forced a response from the defense minister, whose predecessor was forced to resign in 2019 after withholding information over a bombardment in which at least eight minors died.From victims to “war machines”In an interview run by the brother-in-law of President Ivan Duque, Molano countered Hollman’s report that more than 12 underage victims of forced recruitment had died in the bombardment, claiming the military had bombed “war machines who were planning terrorist attacks.”The minister said the military knew there were minors in the alleged FARC dissident camp, incriminating military officers allegedly involved in a crime against humanity.To further undermine his authority, Molano claimed that killed victims of forced recruitment would be “children who are part of a military organization, capable of carrying out attacks.”The minister then contradicted himself, claiming the Southeastern Bloc is a “criminal organization,” which would prohibit the use of lethal force against the dissident guerrillas.Notwithstanding, Molano claimed the bombardment was a “legitimate operation.” Diego MolanoFARC dissidentsnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-defense-chief-under-fire-over-bombing-minors/,Colombia’s defense chief under fire over bombing minors
" The former chief justice of Colombia’s Supreme Court was convicted for corruption on Tuesday after a bribery scandal reached the highest echelons of the country’s justice system.Former magistrate Francisco Ricaurte was convicted on multiple corruption charges for his leading role in the “Toga Cartel,” a collective of top judges and Colombia’s former anti-corruption chief.The corruption scandal of the centuryThe alleged members of the Toga Cartel took bribes from powerful politicians investigated by the Supreme Court in one of the biggest corruption scandals of this century.The scandal was revealed in June 2017 after the United States’ Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) caught the anti-corruption chief of former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez red-handed while bartering a bribe between a corrupt former governor and the cartel.Former Prosecutor Luis Gustavo Moreno became the prosecution’s key witness after allegedly surviving two assassination attempts and serving a prison sentence in the US where he was caught.Almost four years after the DEA dropped the corruption bomb on the Supreme Court, a judge was able to come to a conviction of one of Colombia’s most powerful men.Colombia’s supreme pimp of justice?The Ricaurte caseRicaurte’s defense attorney said he would appeal the decision and asked the judge to revoke an arrest warrant for the former chief justice who was able to leave jail after his initial arrest using a legal loophole.The former chief justice has categorically denied any wrongdoing, which has complicated investigations into the specific dealings of the Toga Cartel and its alleged members.Moreno wasn’t appointed until mid-2016, but according to assistant magistrate Jose Reyes, he began noticing atypical delays in the criminal proceedings against politicians appearing before the Supreme Court since 2015.Ricaurte left the high court in 2012 to become a magistrate of the Superior Judicial Council from where he continued to exercise extraordinary power and was subbed “the power behind the throne” by local media in 2013.Colombia to investigate judges and prosecutors after release of top corruption suspectsThe potential fall-outThe prosecution requested a 24-year sentence for Ricaurte, which could incentivize the former chief justice to use the appeal to seek a plea bargain and cooperate with justice.Even without Ricaurte’s cooperation, the ongoing investigations have already resulted in the conviction of the former anti-corruption chief, and investigations into four former Supreme Court magistrates and almost two dozen former congressmen and former governors.The sheer number of suspects makes the Toga Cartel scandal almost as devastating as the so-called “parapolitics” scandal that saw more than 65 lawmakers and seven governors disappear behind bars over their ties to paramilitary groups between 2006 and 2012. corruptionFrancisco RicaurtenewsletterSupreme Courttoga cartel ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-former-supreme-court-president-convicted-over-mammoth-corruption-scandal/,Colombia’s former Supreme Court president convicted over mammoth corruption scandal

" Colombia’s prosecution should be investigating the alleged corruption of Colombia’s most powerful banker, but opened unrelated criminal investigations instead.In a press release, the prosecution implied in late February that it would revive “the Odebrecht Case,” but apparently forgot to include the biggest stars in the corruption scandal.In fact, none of the “three fronts” in the investigation have anything to do with the corruption-ridden “Ruta del Sol II” project that implicate Colombia’s richest man, Luis Carlos Sarmiento, and former chief prosecutor Nestor Humberto Martinez.Why Colombia could never see Odebrecht’s bribery clarifiedThe prosecution’s “new” investigationsOne of the investigations targets Carlos Alberto Acero, the former subordinate of Jorge Enrique Pizano, who died of cyanide poisoning in November 2018 after blowing the whistle on fraud in the Ruta del Sol II project.A second investigation seeks new criminal charges against the former director of Colombia’s National Infrastructure Agency (ANI), Luis Fernando Andrade, who was absolved by a court in December after being charged for corruption over a contract the former ANI chief never signed.The third investigation involve five businessmen who supposedly were already being investigated for receiving Odebrecht funds allegedly meant to illegally finance political campaigns, including that of former President Juan Manuel Santos.Santos’ former campaign minister, Roberto Prieto, was sentenced to five years in prison for receiving bribes in 2019.Colombia president apologizes for illegal 2010 Odebrecht campaign fundingBeating around the Sarmiento bushThe prosecution announced no criminal investigation into the son of Colombia’s richest man, Grupo Aval CEO Luis Carlos Sarmiento Jr., despite a court order to investigate the banker.Odebrecht’s former Colombia chief, Luis Antonio Bueno, testified in 2019 that an executive of Grupo Aval subsidiary Corficolombiana, Gustavo Ramirez, told the Brazilian businessman he would inform Sarmiento Jr about bribing the deputy Transport minister of former President Alvaro Uribe in 2009.Ramirez and Sarmiento testified in favor of former Corficolombiano CEO Jose Elias Melo, but to no avail. Their former business partner was sentenced to 11 years in prison for his complicity in the bribery practices in December.Sarmiento’s father was allegedly informed about the corruption practices by Colombia’s former chief prosecutor, a.k.a. “Sarmiento’s Guy,” when Martinez was Grupo Aval’s legal adviser in 2015 but is apparently also no person of interest for the prosecution.Colombia defends banking mogul it should be investigating over Odebrecht scandalThe biggest crook of them all?Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa doesn’t seem to be interested in investigating his predecessor despite indications Martinez was complicit in the corruption practices and abused his power as chief prosecutor to cover this up.Pizano, the auditor of the Ruta del Sol II project, told the former chief prosecutor he had found evidence of corruption in August 2015, two months after Brazilian authorities began revealing Odebrecht’s corruption practices.“Sarmiento’s Guy” allegedly told the auditor he would warn Colombia’s richest man after which evidence indicated Martinez dedicated himself to covering up the corruption practices.Days after Odebrecht CEO Marcelo Odebrecht was sentenced to 19 years in prison in Brazil on March 7, 2016, the representatives of Odebrecht and Grupo Aval subsidiaries Episol and Corficolombiana committed to overcome “current differences” over the Ruta del Sol II project and refrain from lawsuits over “the contracts and disbursements made so far.”Martinez tried to keep the corruption under wraps after Sarmiento’s Guy was elected Prosecutor General in mid-2016, but was forced to allow criminal investigations after the United States’ Department of Justice revealed the corruption practices in December 2016.The Supreme Court appointed a special prosecutor to investigate Odebrecht-related suspects after controversial arrest of Andrade in 2017 and the shocking death of Pizano in November 2018.The former ANI chief fled to the US after a judge ordered his release in December and Sarmiento’s Guy resigned in May 2019 amid rumors the chief prosecutor would be shielded from all Odebrecht-related cases.The decision made the Special Prosecutor Leonardo Espinosa redundant after which Martinez’ henchmen raided his office.Colombia puts Odebrecht bribery suspect in charge of infrastructure luis carlos sarmientoNestor Humberto MartinezOdebrecht ",https://colombiareports.com/how-to-evade-investigating-colombias-richest-man-and-sarmientos-guy/,How to evade investigating Colombia’s richest man and ‘Sarmiento’s Guy’
" Colombia’s government is under fire as its chaotic COVID-19 vaccination program has allowed the administration of only 200,000 vaccine shots in two weeks.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz was apparently just saying stuff last month when the minister claimed that health authorities had the capacity to apply “more than 100 thousand daily vaccines” and that “this vaccination capacity can increase.”In his daily appearance on President Ivan Duque’s propaganda show, Ruiz bombarded viewers with meaningless statistics except the one that would reveal the minister’s National Vaccination Plan is a mess.Colombia’s healthcare show: ‘If you get seriously ill, you die’According to statistics released by the Health Ministry at 4PM, less than 15,000 people received a shot in the previous 24 hours.According the National University Professor Jorge Alberto, “the vaccines are arriving at a slower rate than we expected and frankly it looks like it were a surprise.”Additionally, notoriously corrupt healthcare intermediaries (EPS’s) appear to be bungling the distribution of vaccine shots.The vaccination specialist of the Bogota Medical College, Elizabeth Beltran, told television network Caracol she had asked the minister to kick the apparently redundant healthcare intermediaries out of the vaccination program.The rackets that put Colombia’s healthcare system on the brink of collapse“We requested that the decree be revised, that the intermediation of the EPS be eliminated and that it be a public health issue,” said Beltran.Presidential spokesperson Victor Muñoz admitted that the speed of the process “definitely must increase,” but added that he believed that the involvement of the notoriously corrupt EPS’s “will allow us to meet the deadlines.”In fact, Muñoz promised that with only two weeks to go “we will vaccinate a million Colombians in the first month,” which is impossible as the vaccination of one person requires two shots with an interval of three to four weeks.Over the past two weeks, national authorities have received 509.070 shots from international providers and have delivered 340,104, according to the minister.Why the shots are being sent to intermediaries instead of being sent straight to regional health authorities is unclear coronavirushealthcareNational Vaccination Plan ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-chaotic-covid-19-vaccination-plan/,Colombia’s chaotic COVID-19 vaccination “plan”
" The prosecutor who wants to drop a fraud and bribery investigation against Colombia’s ex-President Alvaro Uribe will be facing criminal charges for his alleged attempt to corrupt justice.Two of the victims of Uribe’s alleged criminal practices, Senator Ivan Cepeda and former chief prosecutor Eduardo Montealegre, said they would press criminal charges against prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes.According to Cepeda and Montealegre, the prosecutor broke the law by requesting a judge to drop the criminal investigation initially started by the Supreme Court.Montealegre and Cepeda’s defense attorney Reinaldo Villalba told Noticias Uno they would press criminal charges against Jaimes for purposely ignoring incriminating evidence and witness testimonies.The prosecutor allegedly incurred in “the flagrant disregard of more than 30 pieces of evidences and proof that indicate the responsibility” of Uribe in witness tampering, Montealegre told Noticias Uno on Saturday.Colombia’s prosecution destroys credibility in absurd Uribe investigationProsecution dismissing evidence used in other court casesA Bogota judge will have to decide whether to grant or deny the request of Jaimes who allegedly requested to end the criminal investigation Uribe dismissed evidence used in criminal proceedings against the former president’s alleged co-conspirators.Uribe’s former fixer, Diego Cadena, is being investigated by a different prosecutor for allegedly bribing witnesses at the orders of the former president.House Representative Alfonso Prado is still being investigated by the Supreme Court, which agreed to forward Uribe’s case to the prosecution after the former president reigned from the Senate in August last year.All three found themselves in trouble with justice for allegedly bribing witnesses so that Uribe could press bogus criminal charges against Cepeda in 2014.Colombia’s terrorist former president?The former president pressed the allegedly fraudulent charges after the opposition Senator revealed testimonies and evidence indicating that the former president and his brother Santiago formed paramilitary group “Bloque Metro” when Uribe was governor of his native Antioquia province in the 1990’s.These allegations could have far-reaching implications as the Bloque Metro allegedly helped Uribe become president in 2002, a year after its parent organization, the AUC, was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US Government.Uribe tied to yet another massacre, despite extermination of paramilitary group he allegedly foundedUribe has always denied any ties to the AUC despite evidence and testimonies indicating the opposite.Apart from the witness tampering allegations, the prosecution is also investigating the former president’s alleged complicity in three massacres and a homicide committed by the AUC in 1996 and 1997.The investigations are a major problem for President Ivan Duque who was elected in 2018 with the endorsement of his far-right political patron and one of Uribe’s alleged drug trafficking associates.

" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal ordered the government to take urgent measures to curb the mass killing of demobilized FARC guerrillas.In a press release, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) said Tuesday that “the efforts of the National Government and other State entities are not enough to prevent new assassinations.”According to the JEP, more than 250 former FARC fighters have been assassinated since the now-defunct guerrilla group signed a peace deal with the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos in 2016.The court said that it had ordered the Defense Ministry, the Interior Ministry, President Ivan Duque’s peace commissioner, the prosecution and other state entities to take urgent measures.The JEP found that the Ombudsman’s Office has not created a unit that in a general manner coordinates issues to guarantee the rights of former fighters. There is a low level of compliance with the recommendations made by this entity to the Ministry of the Interior, but there are also no judicial or disciplinary actions brought before the authorities seeking to ensure compliance… regarding the protection of former fighters. Special Jurisdiction for PeaceSo far this year, 10 former guerrillas who are taking part in a reintegration program have been assassinated or forcibly disappeared, according to think tank Indepaz.The former guerrillas, who now have a political party, organized protests in October last year to demand government action against the mass killing.Duque met with the former guerrillas’ leaders in November and visited a rural FARC reintegration site in the troubled Antioquia province in the northwest in December.FARC invades Colombia’s cities!!! (asking for nothing but peace)The Office of the United Nations’ Secretary General warned in December that the ongoing assassination of former fighters and rural communities taking part in the peace process posed “the greatest threat” to the implementation of the peace deal that seeks to end more than five decades of armed conflict.The greatest threat to the implementation of the Final Agreement continues to be the persistent violence against the thousands of men and women who voluntarily laid down their arms in good faith and remain committed to peace, against the communities that have endured violence for decades, and against the social leaders and human rights defenders who work on their behalf.United Nations Secretary GeneralThe JEP highlighted that the assassinations are not just threatening former guerrillas’ ongoing commitment to the peace process, but also “deprives victims of their rights.”The assassinations of FARC members is similar to the mass killing of demobilized fighters of paramilitary organization AUC, which demobilized between 2003 and 2006.FARC dissident groups and paramilitary group AGC have used these assassinations to justify their refusal to lay down arms. armed conflictFARCJEPpeace processpolitical violence ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-government-ordered-to-curb-mass-killing-of-former-farc-fighters/,Colombia’s government ordered to curb mass killing of former FARC fighters
" US President Joe Biden is increasing pressure on Colombia’s President Ivan Duque to stop trying to obstruct justice and his country’s peace process.Biden wrote his Colombian counterpart that he “eager to reinvigorate” relations, but was “committed to a bipartisan agenda” that “contributes towards a durable peace” in Colombia.The February 17 letter was the first time the US President personally reached out to his Colombian counterpart since Biden’s election in November last year.Relations between the two countries strained after US authorities found out that Duque’s far-right party and Colombia’s ambassador to Washington DC were trying to meddle in the US elections.Duque didn’t respond to the letter until Saturday after US Ambassador Philip Goldberg expressed his support for Colombia’s war crimes tribunal, which is opposed by Duque’s Democratic Center party.In a Tweet, Goldberg stressed “the importance our two democracies give to the importance of respect for judicial independence.”Goldberg met with the President of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, magistrate Eduardo Cifuentes on Friday and discussed “Colombia’s efforts to guarantee truth, justice and non-repetition to victims in line with the peace deal” with demobilized guerrilla group FARC, according to the embassy.Colombia’s military suspected of tampering war crime witnessesDuque’s party wants to abolish the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) and the president openly defied a Supreme Court order to detain his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, in August last year.In a speech, the president mentioned that Biden “also” applauded Duque’s decision to formalize the migratory status of refugees from neighboring Venezuela, but remained quiet about the US government’s explicit support for the peace process.Colombia’s Foreign Minister Claudia Blum omitted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s explicit and “strong support for peace” when she announced their first phone call in January.Duque isolated as US vows ‘strong support for peace in Colombia’Washington’s diplomatic moves further complicate Duque’s position as the president has consistently prioritized his party’s sometimes criminal interests over the peace process.If Duque wants to continue to try to interfere in justice or obstruct the peace process he would have to do so without any international support.

" Victims and witnesses of the alleged fraud and bribery practices of Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe claim they are being harassed by the prosecution.According to Senator Ivan Cepeda, the victim of Uribe’s alleged witness tampering to file fraudulent criminal charges against the opposition politician, “they have tried to open three criminal investigations against me” in the past few weeks.In an interview with Noticias Uno, Cepeda said that the prosecution claimed to have found evidence that the lawmaker had unauthorized contact with ELN guerrillas in the office of President Ivan Duque’s peace commissioner.According to Cepeda, the Prosecutor general’s Office found the alleged evidence during an alleged raid in the office of Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos a day after the lawmaker accused Duque’s top peace official of obstructing peace.Why Ceballos’ office was allegedly raided and what evidence the prosecution allegedly found is unclear.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonCepeda’s defense attorney, Reinaldo Villalba, formally asked the prosecution to certify if it is investigating Cepeda, which would be illegal as only the Supreme Court is allowed to investigate congressmen.The defense attorney of one of the key witnesses against Uribe, former paramilitary fighter Juan Guillermo Monsalve, said that the prosecution was trying to discredit the testimonies of Monsalve, who is one of two former paramilitaries who claim the former President formed a death squad in the 1990’s.Monsalve’s attorney, Miguel Angel del Rio, said the prosecution on multiple occasions contacted Monsalve to testify over the past week without the presence of a judge “in order to discredit the witness.”Colombia’s chief prosecutor too busy harassing critics to fight crime?“The Prosecutor’s Office should investigate the conduct related to the alleged criminal responsibility of the suspect, which is Mr. {Alvaro} Uribe, and not the conduct of a witness,” Del Rio told newspaper El Espectador.According to the attorney, his client was already heard by the Supreme Court, which was investigating the former president until Uribe renounced his congressional privileges by resigning from the Senate.Before harassing witnesses and Uribe’s alleged victim, controversial prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes sought to close the investigation and have evidence gathered by the Supreme Court deemed inadmissible, according to local media.Judges barred Jaimes from obstructing his own investigation and forced the prosecutor to continue criminal proceedings using the Supreme Court evidence indicating Uribe bribed witnesses to file fraudulent charges against Cepeda.Colombia’s prosecution destroys credibility in absurd Uribe investigationJaimes’ apparent attempts to protect alleged criminals instead of prosecuting them confirmed allegations the Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa is desperately trying to protect President Ivan Duque’s allegedly criminal allies.The chief prosecutor was previously caught trying to withhold evidence of a conspiracy between Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party and a drug traffickers to rig the 2018 elections.Colombia’s chief prosecutor under fire over investigation into election rigging plotAccording to Monsalve’s attorney, the prosecutor has finished his request to drop the criminal investigation Jaimes is supposed by present before a judge before March 6.Cepeda said he was confident to further humiliate the prosecution with the “abundant and solid evidence presented by the Supreme Court, which ordered the detention of Uribe in August last year.This judge will have to decide whether to absolve Uribe or order Jaimes to file criminal charges against Uribe based on the Supreme Court evidence presented by the prosecution and the victim of Uribe’s alleged crimes.

" Colombia’s ELN guerrillas are struggling to maintain a recent territorial expansion, according to a think tank.In its latest report on the rebel group, think tank Indepaz said that the guerrillas have been able to expand their presence in the countryside, but lack stability to consolidate control.On a national level, the instability of the guerrilla organization is largely due to an absence of a national expansion strategy, difficulties in the recruitment of new members and a shortage in mid-level commanders, according to Indepaz.Regional expansion and difficultiesThrough alliances with regionally active armed groups, the ELN has been able to grow its territorial reach in the center and east of the country, but without the ability to impose guerrilla rule.This has allowed the guerrillas to maintain a permanent presence in 136 of Colombia’s approximately 1,100 municipalities and and increase in temporary or transitory presence from 14 in 2018 to 71 in the first half of 2020.Along Colombia’s Pacific coast, the group’s territorial control is fiercely being disputed by paramilitary groups like the AGC, which is complicating the imposition of guerrilla rule.The ELN’s so-called Urban War Front has maintained presence in Colombia’s largest cities, but has failed to gain support among non-violent sympathizers of the “Liberation Theology” propagated by the guerrillas. ■ Consolidates presence | ■ Temporary / transitory presenceCalling for peace complicates recruitmentColombia’s last-standing rebel groups appears to be in an “institutional” limbo after a 2016 peace deal with demobilized guerrilla group FARC, and peace talks with the ELN that began in 2017 and were suspended in 2019, according to Indepaz.The ELN embarked on a territorial expansion campaign after the 2017 demobilization of the FARC in an apparent effort to increase leverage.This offensive was weakened, however, by the guerrillas’ support for the peace process with the FARC and attempts to negotiate their own disarmament.This made convincing civilians to join the guerrillas a tough sell and wasn’t very successful among demobilized FARC guerrillas either.The ELN certainly recruited some militia members or external collaborators from the FARC, especially in Chocó and the northeast of the country, towards Norte de Santander. Despite this, there is no record of FARC units moving to the ELN at the initiative of mid-level commanders or their deputies, but of militiamen without great capacity for promotion or de facto power.IndepazNonetheless, Indepaz believes the ELN has been able to grow its guerrilla force from 2,500 to 3,000 fighters since 2018.Alliances and rivalriesThe ELN was able to expand its consolidated territory in regions where it reportedly made alliances with other groups.This has been the least successful in the west in the country where the guerrillas are facing fierce resistance from paramilitary group AGC.In southwest Colombia, more than two dozen FARC dissident groups have formed, which has complicated stable alliances.In Antioquia, Colombia’s largest province, the ELN reportedly teamed up with Los Caparrapos, which has also been at war with paramilitary group AGC and has allowed the guerrillas to expand their territory.Also in the northeastern Norte de Santander and Arauca provinces, the ELN has apparently has been able to expand thanks to reported alliances with rearmed guerrillas of respectively the FARC’s 33rd Front and the 10th Front. armed conflictELN ",https://colombiareports.com/the-troubled-expansion-of-colombias-eln-guerrillas/,The troubled expansion of Colombia’s ELN guerrillas
" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal threatened to expel one of former President Alvaro Uribe’s political allies for calling victims of his death squads guerrilla associates.Salvador Arana, Colombia’s former ambassador to Chile who founded his own death squad, asked the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) to release him from prison where he is serving a 40-year sentence.The JEP threatened to expel the terrorist-turned-diplomat from the transitional justice system, claiming that instead of offering his victims compensation, the “Uribista” accused them of being guerrilla associates.Arana has not made a serious recognition of the victims and the legal assets affected by his convictions. Instead, he has simply accused the victims of collaborating with the FARC-EP, engaging in administrative corruption and manipulating witnesses against him.Special Jurisdiction for PeaceBefore the Supreme Court sentenced Arana to 40 years in prison, the far-right politician claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign by opposition Senator Gustavo Petro and accused one of his murder victims of corruption.The Supreme Court dismissed the claims and convicted Arana for using terrorism to get elected, and ordering the assassination of his critics and political rivals.The mayor who foretold his own assassinationLate Mayor Eudaldo Leon Diaz announcing his own assassination on national television (Screenshot: YouTube)Arana became national news on February 1, 2003 when Diaz, the mayor of El Roble, told Uribe on national television that he would be assassinated for filing criminal charges against the former governor over his corruption practices.Look at what they invented and that they planned to kill me. The next step is, I repeat, that they are going to kill me.Late Mayor Eudaldo Leon DiazTwo months after Diaz foretold his own death, the governor paid his paramilitary groups, the Heroes of the Montes de Maria Bloc, $33,000 (150 million pesos) to kidnap, torture and assassinate his critic.The mayor disappeared on April 5 after accepting Arana’s invitation to settle their differences. Five days later, Diaz’ tortured remains were found outside the capital Sincelejo.The former president, who is being investigated for allegedly forming his own death squad, appointed Arana ambassador to Chile later that year.Arana resigned and announced criminal charges against Senator Gustavo Petro in 2005 after the opposition lawmaker revealed evidence of criminal and terrorist activity in Congress.After the prosecution files criminal charges against the Uribe ally in 2006, the “Uribista” went into hiding, but was caught.How to protect your terrorist alliesFormer Prosecutor General and alleged paramilitary associate Luis Camilo Osorio. (Image: Zona Cero)Arana was convicted despite efforts by Uribe and former Prosecutor General Luis Camilo Osorio, who has been accused of being a former associate of paramilitary organization AUC, to make the criminal investigation go away.After Diaz foretold his own death, the former president ordered an investigation, which never took place.After the mayor was found dead, Osorio excluded testimonies by former paramilitaries that incriminated the former governor in 2003, claiming Arana’s exemplary behavior was enough evidence these testimonies were false.The prosecution reopened the investigation again in 2005 and ordered the arrest of Arana in 2006. The former politician was arrested in May 2008 after the assassination of multiple witnesses, including the paramilitary commander paid to murder Diaz.The late mayor’s former bodyguard revoked his statement after his brother was kidnapped and one former paramilitary successfully applied for asylum in Canada after receiving death threats.The Supreme Court assumed the investigation in November that year and needed less than a year to  prove the terrorist-turned-diplomat had not just assassinated Diaz, but had financed the formation of the Heroes of Montes de Maria and used them to terrorize voters into electing Arana governor.“Pitirri,” the former paramilitary fighter who had fled to Canada, helped the Supreme Court incarcerate Uribe’s cousin Mario in 2011.

" President Ivan Duque on Friday vowed to further militarize counternarcotics efforts in an apparent attempt to revive the controversial “Plan Colombia” strategy.During a military ceremony, the far-right president inaugurated the so-called Counternarcotics and Transnational Threats Command (CONAT), a new “elite force” of 7,000 soldiers.The new force replaces the National Army’s Special Counternarcotics Brigade and will support the much larger Joint Task Force units that are fighting illegal armed groups in historically violent areas.Counternarcotics and Transnational Threats Command (CONAT)Reviving Plan Colombia?The CONAT appears to be larger version of the now-defunct Counternarcotics Battalion that was formed in 1999 as part of “Plan Colombia,” a strategy to combat both drug trafficking and illegal armed groups with the US military.Like the Counternarcotics Battalion, the CONAT will consist of ground troops that can count on significant air support.Like in 1999, the president uses drug trafficking as a pretext for increasingly aggressive military action to curb escalating violence by illegal armed groups in the countryside.Drug trafficking is the perverse force that murders social leaders, those who are in the process of returning to legality and is the one that intends to return to sow horror, so today, the security forces will go without contemplation to destroy the structures of drug trafficking.President Ivan DuqueDuque is additionally trying to resume the aerial spraying of coca, a key element of Plan Colombia, which failed as a counternarcotics strategy, according to the United States’ Government Accountability Office (GAO).The Colombian military endeavor cannot count on explicit support from Washington DC, which bankrolled much of the original Plan Colombia.Seeking “victory” during peace processDuque has been under increasing international pressure to implement a 2016 peace deal with demobilized FARC guerrillas and prevent a new cycle of armed conflict.The president’s political and criminal allies have consistently opposed the peace process, which seeks to dismantle illegal armed groups and combat drug trafficking,The peace deal also introduced a war crimes tribunal that is investigating the alleged involvement of the military and Duque’s allies in war crimes.The US Government Accountability Office deemed Plan Colombia a failed counternarcotics policy, yet Colombia’s Defense Minister Diego Molano vowed to “destroy” the country’s illegal armed groups and achieve “victory for all Colombians” using the same strategy.The goal is to fight drug trafficking by air, land and sea without truce, we will put an end to this evil that afflicts Colombia. This will be the victory for all Colombians.Defense Minister Diego MolanoMolano is unlikely to destroy Colombia’s illegal armed groups or achieve “victory” over drug trafficking, but may be able to further plunge Colombia into violent chaos in order to protect his criminal associates.No international supportDuque’s possibly criminal policy cannot count on the support of the United Nations, the European Union or even US President Joe Biden, who supported Plan Colombia as Senator.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken explicitly expressed his support for peace in January and Ambassador Philip Goldberg met with the president of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace on Saturday.UN urges Colombia to dismantle paramilitary groups armed conflictCONATdrug traffickingmilitarypeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/duques-pirate-plan-colombia-copy-latest-blow-to-peace-process/,Duque’s pirate ‘Plan Colombia’ copy latest blow to peace process

" The director of the United Nations’ human rights office in Colombia urged to prioritize a government policy to dismantle paramilitary groups in order to secure peace.In an interview with newspaper El Espectador, High Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR) representative Juliette de Rivero said on Wednesday she had urged the government to step up efforts to dismantling of the illegal armed groups held responsible for much of the country’s persistent violence.According to the HCHR’s annual report, 133 human rights defenders and community leaders were murdered in 133, the highest number since a peace deal with former guerrilla group FARC in 2016.The UN human rights office additionally stressed that it had registered 76 massacres, the highest number since 2014.Intensity of violence against social leaders The HCHR “urges to redouble efforts to implement all chapters of the Peace Agreement. This means reinforcing the security guarantees provided for in the Agreement and promoting the adoption and implementation of a public policy to dismantle criminal organizations, including the successors of paramilitarism through the National Commission of Security Guarantees” (NCSG).According to Rivero, particularly the “networks, these criminal groups, these structures” formed by former members of now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC in collusion with the private sector and the military “are at the origin of the attacks against social leaders.”They attack the leaders because they are trying to silence an entire community and to subjugate an entire community. Dismantling is important to generate conditions in which leaders and communities can live in peace.HCHR representative Juliette RiveroThese paramilitary structures were promoted by President Ivan Duque’s political patron, far-right former President Alvaro Uribe, until the US Government designated the AUC a foreign terrorist organization in 2001.Duque’s failure to summon the commission that is supposed to come up with a policy to effectively dismantle these paramilitary structures has been one of the government’s most blatant failures to comply with the peace deal.Is Duque’s conflict of interest promoting political violence in Colombia?The HCHR additionally stressed that implementing the peace deal “means deploying a comprehensive State presence in the most affected territories” where political violence and armed conflict persists.Dissident FARC groups have used paramilitary violence against demobilized guerrillas to justify rearmament in historically neglected provinces like Cauca and Antioquia.This has put the civilian population, and particularly social leaders, in the line of fire while promoting the peace process. armed conflictNational Commission for Security Guaranteespeace processUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/un-urges-colombia-to-dismantle-paramilitary-groups/,UN urges Colombia to dismantle paramilitary groups
" Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque has recreated the conditions that make a new war almost inevitable, according to political scientist Francisco Gutierrez.In his recently published book, “A new cycle of war in Colombia?,” Gutierrez highlights that Duque’s failure to implement a 2016 peace deal with the FARC almost inevitably will revive the armed conflict.The government’s refusal to implement peace policies, and the surge of a new generation of paramilitary and guerrilla groups, almost exactly recreates the situation that led to the 1964 reactivation of armed conflict, according to the political scientist.The only way to avoid a new armed conflict is the strict implementation of the peace deal, Gutierrez told journalist Maria Jimena Duzan in an interview last week.Without doing so, said the political scientist, a prevention of a new cycle of violence similar to “La Violencia,” which cost an estimated 200,000 lives between 1948 and 1958 and the armed conflict that cost more than 265,000 lives since 1964, would be almost impossible to prevent.A 200-year history lesson to understand the FARC’s conflict with Colombia’s stateFrom the 1st to the 2nd cycle of violenceThe current situation is almost exactly the same as the situation after La Violencia, which the political scientists called the first cycle of violence.La Violencia came to an end after the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party in 1958 agreed to a duopoly that allowed them to end partisan violence by rotating control over the government.The agreement to form a so-called “National Front” allowed the dismantling of many of the illegal armed groups, but allowed the radicalization of former liberal guerrillas like late FARC founder “Manuel Marulanda.”The United States’ Central Intelligence Agency estimated in 1962 that between 1,600 and 2,000 people had joined 11 “Communist” guerrilla groups.“Another 29 non-communist guerrilla groups of approximately 4,500 men continued to exist primarily in the southern and central departments of Colombia” according to the US intelligence agency.Because the Colombian security forces lacked capacity, US Army Lieutenant General William Yarborough proposed the creation of “organized civilian self-defense units and directed them to relieve army units of some patrolling and local garrisoning.”This spurred the former liberal guerrillas and allegedly communist guerrilla groups to merge and form groups like the FARC and ELN.By the late 1990’s, these two groups combined had approximately 24,000 fighters and some 16,000 members of the paramilitary groups initially proposed by the US Army formed national paramilitary organization AUC.How a US military doctrine became Colombia’s ‘origin of evil’ | Part 2: Special warfareFrom the 2nd to the 3rd cycle of violence?Former President Alvaro Uribe’s partial demobilization of the AUC between 2003 and 2006 left a rag-tag bunch of dissident groups of which many were dismantled.Others, however, joined what is now Colombia’s most powerful paramilitary group, the AGC, which again has made alliances with military commanders and businessmen.The peace process agreed by the FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos initially was opposed by an estimated 500 guerrillas who have since formed the Southeastern Bloc, which barely posed a threat.Deliberate attempts to sabotage the peace process, however, spurred demobilized FARC members to rearm. These dissidents have formed more than two dozen dissident groups since 2018.Like the dissident liberal guerrillas in 1960, these FARC dissident groups operate independently.Duque’s 2018 decision to allow the armament of civilians to defend themselves against “bandits” in cooperation with the security forces is hardly any different than the 1960 US Army proposal to do the same.The outcome, consequently, is likely a third cycle of armed conflict unless the government revoked its decisions and implements the peace deal with the FARC, according to Gutierrez. armed conflictpeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/only-peace-process-can-stop-colombias-return-to-war/,‘Only peace process can stop Colombia’s return to war’
" Colombia’s mass vaccination campaign is running into issues over delays in the delivery of vaccines and irregularities with their distribution.President Ivan Duque on Wednesday demanded explanations from COVAX, an international initiative to provide cheap vaccines to poor countries, over shots that were supposed to arrive earlier this month but have yet to arrive.Less vaccines than plannedA spokesperson of the Pan-American Health Organization told local media last week that the first COVAX shipment would arrive this week, which apparently isn’t going to happen.Duque said in January that the National Vaccination Plan foresaw the arrival of 850,000 vaccine shots from multiple providers this month, which will likely be no more than 292,000.So far, multinational pharmaceutical firm Pfizer sent enough vaccines for 50,000 people and Sinovac vaccines that arrived from China last week would be enough to vaccinate 96,000 people.The Chinese pharmaceutical company would send another 2 million shots on March 7, the president said Thursday, claiming he personally spoke to his counterpart in Beijing, Xi Jinping.Regional distribution woesSomething went wrong with the regional distribution of thee first batch of Sinovac shots, however, the Health Secretary of the Tolima province, Jorge Bolivar, told media.According to Bolivar, the Health Ministry ordered the suspension of the administration of the almost 6,000 shots he was sent after alleged refrigeration failures.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz, whose handling of the coronavirus has been marred by controversy, did not confirm the claim.The mayor of the capital Bogota, Claudia Lopez, on Monday complained that he Health Secretary had also not received any new vaccines.According to Our World in Data, which monitors global progress in vaccination, regional health authorities have so far administered approximately 50,000 shots of the 292,000 that have arrived in Bogota.Ruiz previously said Colombia’s health authorities had the capacity to administer 100,000 vaccine shots a day. coronavirusNational Vaccination Plan ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-shows-first-cracks/,Colombia’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign shows first cracks
" At least 11 people were killed in Colombia’s most southwestern municipality over the weekend amid a turf war between drug trafficking groups.Defense Minister Diego Molano told press on Monday that eruption of violence was due to a conflict between “Frente Oliver Sinisterra” (FOS) and “Los Contadores” over who controls the coastal municipality in the Nariño province.Massacre leaves more questions than answersHow many of the victims of the massacre would be assassinated civilians or members of the two different groups killed by their rivals was not immediately certain.Molano said that remains were found dead on four different locations in the municipality and was ambivalent about the motives of the killing in an attempt to avoid determining the mass killing a massacre.The Contadores and the FOS have been at odds over regional drug trafficking routes and illegal mining operations in Nariño since 2018, which has had far-reaching consequences for the local population.Los ContadoresCaptured drug lord “Contador”Los Contadores is a drug trafficking group that was founded by arrested drug lord “Contador” and is made up of former FARC guerrillas and former AUC paramilitaries.The group would have some 150 fighters who try to control drug exports in the port town of Tumaco and the rural coast line and has been the main rival of the FOS.Los Contadores allegedly have an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel from Mexico.Frente Oliver SiniterraFOS leader “El Gringo”The Frente Oliver SIniterra split from the FARC in late 2016 after the former guerrilla group during a bilateral ceasefire with the former government of President Juan Manuel Santos.With the alleged support of the Sinaloa Cartel, the group initially took control over Colombia’s border with Ecuador, which has long been a major drug trafficking routs to ports in Tumaco and the Ecuadorean Esmeraldas province.Following the 2018 murder of three kidnapped Ecuadorean journalists, the FOS became a priority target for security forces from both countries, which weakened the group and spurred the turf war with the Contadores.The wars over Nariño’s richesThe turf war between the FOS and the Contadores is only partly the cause of violence in Nariño and particularly in Tumaco.Guerrilla group ELN, paramilitary group AGC, multiple FARC dissident groups and drug traffickers have been vying for control over the areas abandoned by the FARC as part of the peace process.Former President Juan Manuel Santos and President Ivan Duque on multiple occasions vowed to sent troops to the region with little to no effect.Governor Jhon Rojas has urged the implementation of the peace deal and allow locals to take part in Colombia’s legal economy, which is impossible because most of the province is without road infrastructure due to historic state neglect. coca cultivationContadoresdrug traffickingFOSmassacresNariñopeace processTumaco ",https://colombiareports.com/11-killed-in-eruption-of-narco-violence-in-southwest-colombia/,11 killed in eruption of narco violence in southwest Colombia

" The loss of COVID-19 vaccine shots in Colombia is allegedly creating fear among healthcare workers who have been accused of being part of a fraud conspiracy.The increased tensions followed the reported loss of more than 200 vaccine shots after their arrival in the capital Bogota and a Comptroller General Office (CGO) press release alleging fraud on Tuesday.The CGO specified that 15 shots had gone missing in five hospitals, spurring online conspiracy theories about the “robbery” of vaccines.The director of Medellin’s Pablo Tobon hospital, Andres Aguirre, told Blu Radio that “our nurses are preparing the vaccines trembling” after a hostile public response to the CGO claim that three vaccine shots had gone lost from his hospital.Hospital chemists, who are responsible for receiving the vaccine shots, additionally fear investigations over the loss of vaccines, according to newspaper El Espectador.In a press release, the Medellin hospital specified that it received 1,170 shots and unable to administer three shots, or 0.26% of the delivery.According to the hospital, the loss of a small percentage is normal in the delivery of any medicine. In the case of vaccines, there would always be shots that cannot be administered because a flask breaks or errors in the preparation of syringes.This was confirmed by the president of the Colombian Pharmaceutical Vigilance Association, Angela Caro, who said the CGO “generated unnecessary alarm” claiming shots would be held back.According to a 2005 report by the World Health Organization, as much as 50% of shots went to waste worldwide in the processes of production, distribution and preparation of vaccines.In the case of the Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19, each vial contains enough for five shots.Before this vaccine can be administered, chemists must dilute the vaccine with sodium chloride before the syringes used to apply the shots are filled.In order to produce the exact number of shots with the adequate dosage of vaccine, chemists and nurses would need almost superhuman precision, according to the Pablo Tobon hospital. coronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/tensions-in-colombia-over-lost-covid-19-vaccines/,Tensions in Colombia over lost COVID-19 vaccine shots

" The Americas director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) is a “FARC activist,” Colombia’s far-right former President Alvaro Uribe claimed on Sunday in response to criticism over war crimes.HRW Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco said Uribe and his far-right Democratic Center party were lying and distorting the truth about the civilians who were murdered and presented as guerrillas killed in combat when Uribe was in office.Colombia’s war crimes tribunal announced last week that it would prioritize investigations into the extrajudicial executions of 6.400 civilians between 2002 and 2008 when Uribe was president.Colombia’s military executed more than 6,400 civilians in 6 years: courtThe former president responded by resorting to his old habit of claiming human rights defenders like Vivanco were guerrilla associates or sympathizers on Twitter.Uribe also falsely accused an NGO of bribing a demobilized paramilitary who has claimed the former president and his brother formed a paramilitary death squad in the 1990’s.Vivanco, who consistently rejected the demobilized guerrillas’ war crimes, called the former president’s accusation “absurd.”Uribe has spent decades falsely accusing anyone who criticizes him of links to the FARC. It is time for the former president to learn to discuss without insults, respect the work of defending human rights and end his dangerous stigmatizations.HRW Americas director Jose Miguel VivancoLate Venezuelan President Hugo “Chavez did the same” in response to criticism over human rights, said Vivanco, equating Uribe with his late arch nemesis.Colombia’s former president has been accusing critics, journalists and detractors of all kinds of things, including “terrorism accomplices,” in response to criticism.Last week’s announcement of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace to prioritize the military’s mass killing of civilians implied that almost half of the 12908 combat kills reported by the Defense Ministry between 2002 and 2008 in fact referred to executed civilians.The report tensions with Uribe and the military, which has always claimed that its members were “heroes of the homeland.” Alvaro Uribearmed conflictfalse positivesHRWjose miguel vivancomilitarypeace processWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/uribe-accuses-hrw-chief-of-terrorism-support-amid-war-crime-probes/,Uribe accuses HRW chief of terrorism support amid war crime probes
" Colombia’s prosecution has lost all credibility after trying to obstruct its own investigation into the alleged fraud and bribery practices of former President Alvaro Uribe.Instead of investigating evidence indicating Uribe bribed witnesses in order to file bogus criminal charges against a political opponent, prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes tried to make the investigation and evidence disappear.When that didn’t work the prosecutor interviewed Uribe allies who had nothing to do with the case in an apparent attempt to obstruct his his own investigation and destroy whatever was left of his poor reputation.Prosecution protecting criminalsJaimes made it painfully evident that he believes his job is to protect alleged criminals, instead of prosecuting them.The prosecutor’s attempts to obstruct justice provided more evidence indicating that chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa has turned the Prosecutor general’s Office into a criminal organization.Uribe resigned from the Senate and renounced his congressional privileges in a successful attempt to revoke the Supreme Court decision to file criminal charges and place him under house arrest.Because the Supreme Court can only investigate lawmakers, the court forwarded the case to the the office of Barbosa, a long time friend of Uribe’s protégé, President Ivan Duque.The prosecutor general appointed Jaimes, a far-right extremist, who immediately proceeded to ignore the Supreme Court’s two-year investigation and drop the entire investigation.A judge intervened in what could be this decade’s most blatant act of corruption and indicted Uribe, forcing Jaimes to initiate criminal proceedings.The prosecutor appealed the decision before an appeals court, which also turned down Jaimes’ request to grant the former president impunity despite the bulk of evidence incriminating Uribe.Desperate diversionsThe prosecutor then tried to singlehandedly dismiss hundreds of pieces of evidence that had been approved by the Supreme Court.Again, a court had to intervene and ordered Jaimes to proceed with the investigation using the evidence gathered by the Supreme Court.Instead, the prosecutor decided to question witnesses who had already been heard by the court and question political allies of the former president who have nothing to do with the case.Last but not least, Jaimes decided to investigate one of the key witnesses, his wife and his mother-in-law, on suspicions that ate unclear.The prosecutor informed Uribe’s alleged victim, Senator Ivan Cepeda, he will decide on March 6 whether or not to file criminal charges after having tried almost everything to do the exact opposite.

" The power of Colombia’s president depends on his ability to manage the sometimes opposing interests of those who really control the country, like business associations.While formally a democracy, all presidents of the 21st century have had no choice but to balance serving the public interest with private and even criminal interests.This unstable balance of power is partly due to the country’s political history and culture, and partly a consequence of the country’s armed conflict.The originThe root of the problem is Colombia’s historically weak state, which has never allowed it to stand alone without support.This problem is as old as the Republic itself. Almost immediately after Colombia declared itself independent from Spain in 1810, the country divided between centralists and federalists.The violence that followed between those who wanted a united Colombia and those who wanted a loose federation of independent states may best be compared with the American Civil War.It wasn’t until 1819 that the different regions agreed to becoming one Republic, but led to multiple secessions and rebellions throughout Colombia’s history.Until 1902, eight more wars broke out, often in resistance to Bogota’s intent to impose state authority in strongly anti-centralist regions or secular rule.This constant violence kept Bogota weak, contrary to rural economic forces and cartels that found inspiration in the economic models proposed by Fascism and National Socialism in the first half of the 20th century.Colombian Agriculture Society (SAC)The predecessor of the Colombian Agriculture Society was founded in 1904 by prominent landowners. Five years later, the government agreed the SAC would become the government’s advisory board on agriculture issues “without detriment to its autonomy as a private trade association.” The government ordered that every provincial capital was required to have an office of the SAC, which continues to be one of the most important lobby groups for large landowners.National Coffee federation (Fedecafe)The National Coffee Federation was founded in 1920 as a price-fixing cartel, which it in essence has remained.National Banking Association (Asobancaria)The National Banking Association was founded in 1936 in order to optimize cooperation between the government and banks, both public and private. The association was mainly self-regulatory without their conduct being defined by the law with the purpose of protecting the banks’ interests, which it still does in collusion with the government despite increasingly strict international banking regulations. National Association of Industrialists (ANDI)The National Association of Industrialists was founded in 1944 inspired by Benito Mussolini’s idea of “corporatism” that sought strong influence of industry leaders in the formulation of economic policy. The ANDI has historically promoted protectionism, has been tied to paramilitary violence and continues to be one of the most powerful lobby groups when it comes to the definition of economic policy.National Commerce Federation (Fenalco)Fenalco, which was formed in 1945, wanted to promote an oligopoly in which a small group of business leaders effectively controlled the economy, similar to Mussolini’s idea of “corporatism.” The organization continues to be one of the most extremist business associations that fiercely resists any state regulation they believe would hinder their idea of free enterprise. The organization has long been associated with paramilitary violence and opposes any form of social protest.Colombian Ranchers’ Federations (Fedegan)The Colombian Ranchers federation was founded in 1963 in response to government attempt to push through a rural reform. The group has been one of the most militant business organizations and one of the main sponsors of the foundation of paramilitary group AUC. Despite indications of corruption, the interest group is managing the government’s “National Cattle Ranchers’ Fund” virtually without oversight.The current situationMost of the business associations that were founded in the first half of the century continue to dominate the government’s economic policy in a way that is either alien or illegal in other countries.Global economic changes have particularly strengthened and enriched the members of the banking association, which is almost entirely controlled by three corporations, Grupo Aval, Bancolombia and GNB Sudameris, who have dissuaded the entrance of foreign banks in Colombia.Grupo Aval of business mogul Luis Carlos Sarmiento has bankrolled presidential campaigns perhaps since the 1980’s, which has given the corporation almost limitless access to the government of President Ivan Duque.Sarmiento’s 2012 acquisition of Colombia’s leading daily, El Tiempo, has additionally given the corporation major influence over public opinion.Some of the associations’ involvement in crimes against humanity that were committed during the armed conflict makes them formidable opponents of the peace process as prominent businessmen would end up in prison.This is particularly the case with Fedegan, whose boss Jose Felix Lafaurie has used his ties to Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, for legal protection.Business associations ANDI and Fenalco have most influence over the president’s economic policy. corruptionculture ",https://colombiareports.com/the-presidents-bosses-part-1-colombias-business-associations/,The president’s bosses | Part 1: Colombia’s business associations
" The metropolitan area of Colombia’s second largest city Medellin became the capital of extrajudicial executions when President Alvaro Uribe was in office.At least 354 Medellin residents were executed by the security forces between 2002 and 2008, according to the country’s war crimes tribunal.The investigation into extrajudicial executions overlaps a second investigation into the hundreds of people who disappeared in Medellin during the armed conflict.Medellin could be Latin America’s largest mass grave, Colombia’s war crimes tribunal finds outWhere were the mayors and governors?The investigation again calls into question the role of Antioquia Governor Anibal Gaviria, former Governor Luis Perez and presidential candidate Sergio Fajardo.The role of Fajardo and Gaviria in forced disappearance in Medellin and their apparent attempts to wipe the war crimes under the rug were already being investigated by the JEP.While the investigation into the security forces’ mass killing of civilians focuses primarily on military commanders, the disappearance of many of these victims in Medellin and the surrounding province was ignored by local and regional leaders.Instead, Fajardo and Gaviria were promoting an international propaganda campaign claiming that Medellin as a city that had “transformed” into an “innovative” city after the killing of local drug lord Pablo Escobar in 1993.Gaviria was elected in 2003 with the alleged support of Escobar’s successor, “Don Berna,” and other leaders of now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC.Both Gaviria and Fajardo have been criticized for turning a blind eye to the fact that the demobilization of Berna’s “Oficina de Envigado” between 2003 and 2006 was largely fake.Extrajudicial executions in Medellin and AntioquiaThe controversial 7th DivisionThe main suspect in the investigation into extrajudicial executions is the controversial 7th Division, which allegedly carried out a quarter of all Colombia’s’ 6,400 extrajudicial executions in Medellin.According to the JEP, the Medellin-based army division executed at least 1,611 civilians in Antioquia between 2002 and 2008, almost twice as much as believed by the prosecution.Victims in AntioquiaThe alleged architectPresident Alvaro Uribe promoted one of the alleged architects of the mass killings, General Mario Uribe of the 4th Brigade, commander of the National Army after turning Medellin into Colombia’s capital of extrajudicial executions.This promotion coincided with a rapid increase in the mass killings throughout Colombia.Medellin has been a laboratory for state violence and terrorism since before the death of Escobar. armed conflictfalse positivesJEPMedellinpeace processWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/medellin-colombias-extrajudicial-execution-capital/,Medellin: Colombia’s extrajudicial execution capital
" The sinister practice of Colombia’s army to inflate combat kills by executing civilians could have legal implications for far-right former President Alvaro Uribe and other politicians.The country’s war crimes tribunal announced to prioritize the extrajudicial executions between 2002 and 2008 when Uribe was in office.The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) confirmed the army began executing civilians before Uribe too office, but stressed that 78% of the victims were murdered after the former president’s so-called “Democratic Security” policy took force.The purpose of the JEP is to establish who is ultimately responsible for which the transitional justice court is currently trying commanders, mainly from the National Army.The former president was quick to stress he never even insinuated executing civilians as the transitional justice court may also investigate allegedly responsible politicians.The investigation into the kidnapping practices of former guerrilla group FARC showed that the JEP is not just filing criminal charges against those who ordered war crimes, but also those who were complicit.Colombia’s war crimes tribunal exposes former guerrillas’ sinister kidnapping practicesFormer President Alvaro UribeFormer President Alvaro UribeAs commander-in-chief, Uribe was ultimately responsible for the Armed Forces in the years that the army executions rapidly escalated.The former president personally promoted the top military officials, like retired General Mario Montoya, who are believed to be main promotors of the sinister practice.Additionally, Uribe was the primary political beneficiary of the mass execution of civilians whose murders were broadly publicized as combat kills that would confirm the success of the former president’s security policy.Uribe would not be the only one who may share responsibility. His four former defense ministers may also have played a role or may have neglected to take action after human rights organizations sent out alerts over the escalating practice.Extrajudicial executionsVice-President Marta Lucia RamirezVice-President Marta Lucia RamirezColombia’s Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez was Uribe’s first defense minister and responsible for the implementation of the “Democratic Security” policy.Ramirez was for example responsible when Uribe issued a state of military emergency in August 2002 and another decree that effectively imposed military rule in so-called “Rehabilitation and Consolidation Areas.”According to preliminary prosecution statistics, the number of extrajudicial executions shot up from 13 in 2001 to 248 in 2003 when the defense minister stepped down amid piling human rights scandals.Former Defense Minister Jorge Alberto UribeFormer Defense Minister Jorge Alberto UribeRamirez’ successor, Jorge Alberto Uribe, was appointed defense minister in November 2003 and resigned in July 2005, reportedly because of the businessman’s failures to receive the support from the military.At the time of Uribe’s resignation, National Army commander General Reynaldo Castellanos said his combat results were largely due to the outgoing minister.In 2005, however, the number of extrajudicial executions had risen to almost 386, according to the preliminary prosecution statistics.Former Defense Minister Camilo OspinaFormer Defense Minister Camilo OspinaUribe’s third defense minister, Camilo Ospina, lasted only a year in office and may have played the most controversial role in the army’s rapidly escalating extrajudicial executions practices.Ospina issued the infamous Directive #29, which granted rewards to members of the military for reported combat kills, in November 2005.In June 2006, the defense minister additionally ordered to forward investigations into homicides committed by the military to the notoriously ineffective military justice system.The prosecution later noted that extrajudicial executions in 2006 nearly doubled to 753.Former President Juan Manuel SantosFormer President Juan Manuel SantosFormer President Juan Manuel Santos became Uribe’s fourth and longest-lasting defense minister in July 2006 and tried to put an end to the mass killings after international media broke the scandal in 2008.The year before the scandal blew up, however, the security forces were executing approximately three people and presenting them as combat kills on an almost industrial scale.“Three common elements were identified: the presentation of civilian victims as combat kills, the alteration of the scene of the crime by the perpetrators and the investigation of the facts by the military criminal justice system,” the United Nations reported in 2007 without Santos taking any action.Former chief prosecutor Mario IguaranMario IguaranFormer Prosecutor General Mario Iguaran agreed not to prosecute members of the military facing homicide investigations, but to allow the military to try its own crimes.This June 2006 decision ignored international humanitarian law that dictates that civilian homicides are no matter for military justice.Because Colombia’s military justice system is notoriously ineffective, this effectively granted many members of the National Army impunity and allowed the mass killing of civilians to become even more widespread.How politicians are triedThe JEP at the moment can only try politicians if they have voluntarily submitted to the transitional justice system.If the court finds evidence Uribe and other politicians were allegedly involved in war crimes, the transitional justice system is obliged to forward this evidence to the ordinary justice system.Neither the president nor any of the former government officials involved in the decision-making related to the army’s mass killing of civilians have submitted to the JEP.This mean that Uribe has presidential immunity and his former ministers would have to be tried by Congress notoriously ineffective Accusations Committee.The Supreme Court would have jurisdiction to try controversial former chief prosecutor Mario Iguaran. armed conflictfalse positivesJEPmilitarypeace processWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/will-the-politicians-behind-colombias-mass-killing-of-civilians-go-to-court/,Will the politicians behind Colombia’s mass killing of civilians go to court?

" Colombia’s government is destroying the future of the country’s children, teenagers and young adults as it is bungling its economic reactivation plans.While many people somehow recovered employment after the biggest economic crash in history last year, young adults fell behind, particularly in the urban areas.Unemployment among people between 18 and 24 went from 17.7% in 2019 to 24.2% last year, according to the DANE, which said general unemployment had gone from 10.5% to 15.9%.Job opportunities for young women were worse than any other group; their unemployment rate went from 23% in 2019 to was 31.7% last year.The government of President Ivan Duque, who falsified his diploma, appears to have no plan to curb youth unemployment or provide education to teenagers and children.Colombia tries to recover loss of formal jobs with informal laborNo education = no futureThe high unemployment rate among young people is “fundamentally due to the disconnect between the education system and the work place, the lack of dialogue between labor preparation and labor demand,” according to economist Ivan Jaramillo of the Rosary University.This is only getting worse, because Education Minister Maria Victoria Angulo’s failure to implement health protocols has and her refusal to provide them with internet has kept children and teenagers home for almost a year, according to teachers union FECODE.For almost a year, teachers have been giving online education while those without internet were left without education, which would cause an even bigger gap between the needs of the labor market and these young Colombians’ technical and cognitive skills.Colombia’s schools closed indefinitely after reopening plans flunkNot even Bogota can do itBogota Mayor Claudia Lopez has been trying to convince the public school teachers in the capital to resume classes on a rotational model on Monday. Only eight of the 130 public schools were able to, according to Canal 1.The District Association of Education Workers insisted that “it is not safe to return to school,” contradicting Bogota’s Education Secretary, which insisted all health protocols were in place.It’s better to lose a year than life.District Association of Education WorkersParents agreed with the Bogota teachers association while FECODE added that poor children are still be unable to take part in the rotational system as no effort has been made to allow them to take part in online classes.In the countryside some schools have been able to reopen, but others still don’t have running water and others are even more in ruins than before the pandemic, according to FECODE.The Paulo VI school in Colombia, Huila (Image: Fecode)Governing with ignorance“An urgent diagnosis of each institution is required… that will allow us to reveal what is available and what is required to return” to school, FECODE said in a press release.During a visit to the largely rural province of Arauca, President Ivan Duque on Sunday pretended his reactivation plan was a success like he did the day before in Boyaca.Our commitment is to education from early childhood to higher education, and with this delivery of these learning environments we take a big step in the transformation of the territories and ratify our commitment as a government to education and the future of the children and young people of the country.President Ivan DuqueAngulo admitted she had finished only five of the 15 school renovation projects in Arauca.

" Colombia’s far-right government sunk in an even deeper legal and diplomatic crisis on Sunday after bungling an attempt to meddle in Ecuador’s presidential elections.Mafia puppet president Ivan Duque had already isolated himself after his far-right Democratic Center party meddled in the US presidential election in November last year in opposition of President Joe Biden.An apparent conspiracy between government-loyal weekly Semana and presumably the president’s National Intelligence Directorate (DNI) backfired after Ecuador’s prosecutor general claimed that a late mid-level commander of guerrilla groups ELN invested in the campaign of the leading candidate in the Ecuadorean elections six weeks after his death.A week before Ecuador’s first round of elections, weekly Semana, published unsubstantiated claims that mid-level guerrilla commander ELN Uriel sought to invest $80,000 in the campaign of presidential candidate Andres Arauz.The Gnecco crime family’s latest conspiracy theoryIn “The explosive files of Uriel,” Semana claimed that “intelligence officials” found that the mid-level ELN commander had saved communications delivered by human couriers in 2 million Word files until his death on October 25.According to Semana, the files enter the chain of custody after they had been released by the unidentified intelligence agency, indicating they may have been tampered with.The weekly has been publishing conspiracy theories on almost a weekly basis after shady banker Jaime Gilinski put a member of the notorious Gnecco crime family, Vicky Davila, in charge of the magazine.Other media ignored Semana’s latest conspiracy theory and Arauz won the first round of elections with 32.7% of the votes on January 7.The difference between businessman Guillermo Lasso, who received 19.7% of the vote, and indigenous candidate Yaku Perez, who received 19.4% of the vote, was too close to call to define who will take on the progressive candidate in the second round on April 11.Colombia’s mafia and the media | Part 1: Vicky DavilaColombia’s mafia puppet prosecutor gets involvedProsecutor General Francisco Barbosa traveled to Quito on Friday to surrender the alleged evidence of the guerrilla support for Arauz to his Ecuadorean counterpart Diana Salazar, which triggered a storm of criticism over his alleged election meddling.According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, Salazar “signed an act of surrender” in order to “guarantee the chain of custody” reportedly breached by the intelligence agency.The attempt became an embarrassment on Sunday when Ecuadorean critics pointed Arauz didn’t register as a candidate until December 8, six weeks after the ELN guerrilla’s death.Ex-President Ernesto Samper, a critic of Duque, called Barbosa “a disgrace” and claimed that the unsubstantiated claims made by Semana were “part of a dirty game that is being orchestrated from Colombia by radical wings on the right from both countries.”As if the lessons learned from the recent interference of Colombia’s ruling party, the Democratic Center, in the US elections in favor of candidate Trump and against President Biden in the state of Florida were not enough.Former President Ernesto SamperThe Grupo de Puebla, a collective of progressive political parties from Latin America, also said to “fiercely reject the attempt to link Andres Arauz” with the ELN.Barbosa found himself ridiculed on social media.The DNI has given Semana a new conspiracy theory already, this time claiming it had obtained the ELN’s strategy “to protect” Venezuelan President Nicolas “Maduro in the event of a military incursion from the United States.”Jaime Gilinski: Colombia’s ghost bankerThe cheap Uribe copyThe apparent conspiracy of the government of President Ivan Duque and weekly Semana is similar to a 2008 plot by the president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.Following a bombing on a FARC camp across the border from Ecuador, Uribe used fabricated information from computers allegedly found at the guerrilla camp to criminalize the opposition and critics.The Supreme Court dismissed the computers as evidence because of breaches in the chain of custody.The government last year was forced to pay damages to the victims of Uribe’s false claims that members of the opposition had ties to the FARC.The former president is currently investigated by the Supreme Court for conspiring with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 elections in the favor of Duque.

" Colombia’s coronavirus vaccination drive kicks off on Wednesday with controversies over unreported vaccines and a highly infectious strain from Brazil.The government of President Ivan Duque pushed the start of its National Vaccination Plan forward to Wednesday after allegedly receiving the first 50,000 vaccines from pharmaceutical firm Pfizer on Monday.These vaccines will be distributed regionally depending on the number of first line healthcare workers per province, according to Health Minister Fernando Ruiz.National Vaccination Plan schedule“Chaotic” start of vaccination driveThe vice-president of the Colombian Medical Federation, Carolina Corcho, called the prioritization of Health Minister Fernando Ruiz “chaotic” and stressed the shots would vaccinate 25,000 people.The Prizer vaccine requires a second shot that ought to be administered 21 days after the first, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention.According to the health minister, the pharmaceutical company will send another 50,000 shots in the first week of March.The ministry’s regional distribution list indicated that the government is taking no risk as the capital Bogota and the country’s 32 departments will be only be delivered even numbers.Strangely, the list said 208 shots less than received would be distributed.Regional progress on vaccinationThe Amazonas dilemmaThe insecurity is causing particular concern in the southern Amazonas province, which borders Brazil and has been cut off from the rest of the country after the detection of a more infectious strain originating from the neighboring country.Amazonas will receive 54 shots, which would allow the guaranteed of 27 of its 335 first line healthcare workers, who have been designated the top priority group.Governor Jesus Galindo called on the government to prioritize the mass vaccination of his province to create an “epidemiological buffer” that would prevent the Brazilian strain from spreading in the rest of Colombia.Ruiz said to be studying the possibility of prioritizing Amazonas after the arrival of 192,000 Sinovac shots from China on Saturday.These shots would be enough to vaccinate the approximately 80,000 inhabitants of Amazonas, including the 50,000 living in the border city Leticia.Race against the clockDuque is under pressure after the president promised to have vaccinated 35 million of Colombia’s 50 million inhabitants before the end of the year, three months before congressional elections.Like in other countries, the delivery of the vaccines is not going according to plan though.The government admitted on Tuesday that it would only receive 337,000 shots of multiple providers in February instead of the 850,000 promised last month.With elections approaching, opposition parties in Congress are particularly critical about the roll-out of the unprecedented vaccination campaign while coalition parties are nervous that delays could cost them seats.

" Colombia’s Defense Minister Diego Molano said Tuesday that he believes he can finally “achieve victory against drug trafficking” after more than three decades.Molano, a business administrator, was appointed by President Ivan Duque after former Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo died of COVID-19 last month.In an interview with newspaper El Espectador, the new defense minister said he would continue Trujillo’s “frontal attack” and “achieve victory against drug trafficking.”When asked about specifics, however, Molano’s priorities sounded significantly different than that of his predecessor.US counternarcotics in Colombia: a prehistory Trujillo and his predecessor, Guillermo Botero, focused almost entirely on the forced eradication of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine.Molano exposed to have a more broader vision on counternarcotics and public security.To achieve victory against drug trafficking we have to attack the entire drug trafficking chain with the eradication of coca crops, the dismantling of laboratories, and the tracking of drug trafficking money.Defense Minister Diego MolanoPerhaps most importantly, the new defense minister made social investment in historically neglected rural regions an explicit part of his security policy.These investment plans are part of a 2016 peace deal with demobilized FARC guerrillas that is fiercely opposed by Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party, but endorsed by the US Government.Realigning with Washington DC?The defense minister indicated he had listened to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who recently stressed his support for peace and the dismantling of drug trafficking organizations.Molano said he was “certain we will achieve victory against these groups in several regions” combining military efforts with the rural investment.The defense minister remained quiet about a possible resumption of the aerial spraying of coca, which Molano last week said to be pursuing like his predecessor had before him.This controversial strategy was explicitly endorsed by former US President Donald Trump, but has not been suggested by the administration of trump’s successor, US President Joe Biden.Colombia’s new defense minister may be saying he will continue his predecessor’s policies, but indicated he was searching for policies that could count on the new American government’s support.

" Colombia’s government and traditional political parties have made and proposed changes that could complicate free and fair elections next year.The latest controversy arose on Monday when the director of the Federation of Municipalities, Gilberto Toro, to postpone next year’s congressional and presidential elections so they coincide with local elections.Toro’s claim that postponing the elections until 2023 would save a “loads of money” was discarded quickly by the opposition and independent parties.Vote-buying preparationsHolding all elections on one day may be cheaper for the tax payer, but also for dark forces who obtain political power through vote-buying.President Ivan Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party and its coalition partner, Radical Change, would have difficulty buying vote next year as both are being investigated for election fraud by the Supreme Court.The government’s low approval rating and the coronavirus further increase the chances for opposition parties and anti-corruption candidates in next year’s elections.The criminal investigations and electoral insecurity would make it more difficult for corrupt candidates to find illegal investments from businesses who may fear losing their investment.Buying Colombia’s local elections: a user’s manualGood-ole riggingWith the approval of Congress, Duque has given National Registrar Alexander Vega considerably more powers and a massive budget increase, raising additional concerns.The National Registrar has the faculty to simply deny evidence of fraud, which was a problem before the controversial Vega was appointed and given extra powers already.Evangelical party MIRA was expelled from the Senate through in 2014 using a fraud scheme that allegedly secured the 2018 election of between 10% and 20% of Congress.Both Vega and his predecessor Juan Carlos Galindo refused to investigate this, which caused major tensions following the last elections.Colombia’s 2014 elections were sabotaged: State CouncilVoter exclusionDuque has refused to reestablish diplomatic ties with Venezuela, which bars approximately 3 million citizens who are living in the neighboring country from taking part in the elections.Former presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Alvaro Uribe also distrusted the electoral preference of Colombian migrants in Venezuela, and refugees in particular.Santos claimed in 2018 that his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro was paying Colombian residents to vote without providing any evidence.This distrust now apparently targets Colombians who have returned from the neighboring country. According to newspaper El Tiempo. Colombians fleeing Venezuela were part of another plot by Maduro to influence the elections.The national registrar told the newspaper he was considering action.Duque’s fear for Colombia’s migrant votesVoter manipulationPresidential intelligence agency DNI appears to be colluding with El Tiempo and weekly Semana to publish all kinds of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories over electoral meddling plots from Venezuela and Cuba.The socialist island state, for example, would have a strategy to bolster “support networks that favor their interests, pressure governmental decisions, co-opt supporters of the revolution and generate destabilization of the democratic system and institutions,” Semana reported in January.So far, the baseless claims haven’t accused specific candidates or parties of receiving outside support, but appear to be seeking to generate a general distrust of opposition.Ironically, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, Semana and apparently the DNI colluded to falsely accuse the progressive candidate in Ecuador’s elections of receiving financial support from guerrilla group ELN.Colombia bungles conspiracy to meddle in Ecuador’s electionVoter intimidationFar-right group Aguilas Negras, which is associated with the security forces, has been publishing death threats that seek to intimidate supporters of opposition Senator Gustavo Petro.This intimidation is aggravated by violence from all kinds of illegal armed groups targeting human rights defenders and community leader who exercise significant influence over voters with a moderate or left-wing tendency.The Office of the United Nations Secretary General warned in December that this violence is increasingly spilling over to political parties from all sides of the political spectrum.The president said in December he wanted to form a new intelligence agency, the CI3T, “for the exchange and evaluation of intelligence information that allows the monitoring and anticipation of terrorist actions.”This agency would seek to discourage “inciting hatred,” a term used to stigmatize opposition, and “provide legitimacy to the State,” a term used to justify the abuse of power.The so-called anti-terrorism campaign would specifically target young people, whose political activity has been criminalized for decades. 2022 electionselection fraud ",https://colombiareports.com/will-colombias-2022-elections-be-free-and-fair/,Will Colombia’s 2022 elections be free and fair?
" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal ordered investigations into the military for allegedly tampering witnesses testifying against former commanders over the mass killing of civilians.The Special Jurisdiction for Peace formally asked the Prosecutor General’s Office and Inspector General’s Office to investigate witness claims that lawyers provided by the military were telling former soldiers not to incriminate generals “to avoid problems” in 2019 and last year.One soldier testified that attorneys provided by the Specialized Technical Defense Fund (Fondetec) “told us: what evidence do you have to link [retired] general [Mario] Montoya, the [former] commander of the army. Your situation could be turned upside down.”Montoya is suspected of being one of the architects of the sinister practice to execute civilians and present them as guerrillas killed in combat that became common under former President Alvaro Uribe.How Colombia’s former army chief is drowning in his own buckets of blood According to soldiers, Fondetec had been manipulating witnesses “to improve the defense of those in the top” of the military, which is investigated for the killing of between 2,500 and 10,000 civilians is being complicated by Fondetec, soldiers told the transitional justice court.The military allegedly sought to also manipulate imprisoned soldiers during a two-day “Educational Course About the Integral System for Truth, Justice and Reparation and Psycho-Social Assistance for Witnesses Before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace” in late 2018.Fondetec director Jorge Arturo Ramos told government-loyal newspaper El Tiempo that no attorney provided by the military had been instructed to tamper witnesses.Never have instructions that would break the law been given and we are working to strengthen this free specialized technical defense mechanism for the heroes of the homeland.Fondetec director Jorge Arturo RamosNeither the Prosecutor General’s Office nor the Inspector General’s Office have followed up the February 2 investigation order, according to Ramos.At least one civilian witness against Montoya survived an assassination attack.

" Native Colombia lost one of its most important leaders to COVID-19 on Saturday, the national indigenous organization ONIC announced.Luis Fernando Arias, the Chief Counselor of the ONIC, died in a hospital in the northern city of Barranquilla weeks after testing positive to the coronavirus.“His return to the bosom of Mother Earth fills us with sadness,” said the Indigenous Organization of Antioquia in a press release, adding that “today we didn’t just lose a brother, but a leader of the regional and country’s indigenous peoples.Native Colombia ‘s recommended response to the coronavirus: return to the originThe organization representing 212 indigenous communities from the northwestern province said they will remember the ONIC director as “an example that will motivate us to continue working for the demand and vindication of the rights of the communities, the good life, and our guiding principles of Unity, Territory, Culture and Autonomy.”Native Colombia today is mourning the loss of an invaluable leader, who leaves an indelible legacy in the social processes of the indigenous peoples of the country and of Antioquia, as well as in the social and popular sectors with whom he also wove bonds of unity.Indigenous organization of AntioquiaPresident Ivan Duque, who has had a tense relationship with indigenous peoples since taking office, praised Arias as “a great man, leader and representative.”“The indigenous peoples declare a national mourning,” said Senator Feliciano Valencia, another prominent indigenous leader from the Nasa people in southwestern Colombia.“We say farewell to one of the most important leaders of the indigenous movement,” added the native Colombian senator.Colombia’s largest labor union CUT expressed their remorse about the loss of Arias, who they called a “companion and friend.”Native Colombia’s fighting COVID without governmentArias was a member of the Kankuamo people from northern Colombia where they are known as the “guardians of the global balance.”The elder had been the most senior leader of the ONIC for almost a decade and one of the main coordinators of the indigenous people’s response to the pandemic last year. coronavirusindigenous issuesLuis Fernando Arias ",https://colombiareports.com/native-colombia-in-mourning-over-loss-of-leader-to-covid-19/,Native Colombia in mourning over loss of leader to COVID-19
" Colombia’s government will receive the first COVID-19 vaccines only days before the National Vaccination Plan is set to kick off, newspaper El Tiempo reported Sunday.The government-loyal newspaper said the first 50,000 vaccines out of a promised 10 million from US pharmaceutical firm Pfizer will arrive in Bogota on Wednesday and Thursday.With these 50,000 vaccines, the Health Ministry and local authorities on Saturday hope to kick off the National Vaccination Plan that seeks to vaccinate 35 million of Colombia’s 50 million inhabitants before the end of the year.Neither Pfizer not the government confirmed the newspaper’s claim that was allegedly based on the government work document.Confusion about vaccines’ arrival and injectionThe government of President Ivan Duque initially said it would be receiving more than 800,000 vaccines in February, which was later lowered to 135,000.According to El Tiempo, the arrival of the 50,000 Pfizer shots is guaranteed, adding that “more could arrive this week, according to the Health Ministry’s expectations.”The Health Ministry previously said to also expect vaccines from the international COVAX initiative this month, but the exact arrival date of these shots has apparently not been confirmed.According to the Health Ministry, people will be able to check where and when they will receive their vaccine through the online platform “Mi Vacuna,” which was launched on Friday and suffered blackouts on Sunday morning.Healthcare workers ‘to receive first jabs’The newspaper reported that first line healthcare workers from the capital Bogota and the populated Antioquia and Valle del Cauca provinces would receive the first vaccines.El Tiempo ‘s claims were incomprehensible. Based on the national distribution of Colombia’s first line health workers, the newspaper said that Bogota would receive 12,852 shots before Saturday of the first batch, another 6,570 would be sent to Antioquia capital Medellin and the remaining 5,184 to Cali, the capital of Valle del Cauca.This is less than half of the vaccines reportedly arriving this week though. Nevertheless, the newspaper implied that the first batch would also be distributed to other regions and would vaccinate 16% of Colombia’s estimated 300,000 first line healthcare workers,This would include sending 12 vaccines to the remote Vaupes province, which would make little sense logistically.Elderly must wait?All people of 80 years and older are the highest priority group of five in the government’s National Vaccination Plan.According to El Tiempo, however, these people would have to wait until the health workers are vaccinated.National Vaccination Plan scheduleThe global vaccination campaign is an unprecedented challenge for both the pharmaceutical industry and governments worldwide and has been marred by hiccups.The Colombian government has been explicit about the kick-off of the National Vaccination Plan on Saturday and its intended finish by the end of the year.But unlike El Tiempo, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz has been reluctant to reveal any other specifics and possibly provide false hope as delays beyond his control are as likely to happen in Colombia as anywhere else in the world. coronavirusNational Vaccination PlanPublic health ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-to-receive-first-50k-covid-19-vaccines-this-week-report/,Colombia to receive first 50K COVID-19 vaccines this week: report
" Colombia’s peace commissioner seems unable to understand that no country in the world would threaten global peace just to please far-right President Ivan Duque.The international community appears to have given up on the Colombian government Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos who continues to deny that, unlike every other government in the world, the Duque administration has no obligation to honor international agreements between states.Despite international warnings Duque sought to violate his country’s international obligations, the president has consistently demanding the extradition of ELN peace negotiators who are in Cuba awaiting the resumption of peace talks Duque suspended after taking office in 2018.How terrorism works | Part 1: Colombia’s ELN guerrillasCeballos’ fantasy worldFollowing a terrorist attack in January 2019 that killed more than 20 police cadets, Colombia’s president demanded the extradition of the ELN peace negotiators, claiming they were involved in the attack.This would mean a breach of the international agreement made ahead of the talks that obliged the Colombian state to facilitate the ELN guerrillas a safe return to Colombia in the even the peace talks broke down.Newspaper El Espectador again tried to explain extraditing the ELN chiefs would make both Colombia and Cuba violate agreements made with multiple states and the United Nations, and severely complicate any possible future peace talks elsewhere in the world.Among other almost hilarious demonstrations of the delusions of the graduate of one of Colombia’s universities most aligned with organized crime, the Sergio Arboleda University, the peace commissioner insisted Cuba has the “international obligation” to do what Colombia’s government says.Sergio Arboleda University: educating Colombia’s mafia Duque’s isolationDuque received the support of far-right former US President Donald Trump, but has been isolated since President Joe Biden took office.Contrary to tradition, Biden has yet to call the Colombian counterpart over tensions the Duque administration interfered in the US elections in support of Trump.US Secretary Antony Blinken, however, stressed the US Government’s support for peace, Ceballos and his boss have yet to show interested in.State convicted for “the worst massacre” in the history of Colombia’s armed conflictCeballos’ creative understanding of his jobIn an other surprising demonstration Ceballos may not understand his job, the peace commissioner said his job was not to promote peace in Colombia, but to “verify the real willingness for peace of the counterpart.”Ceballos previously bungled ongoing efforts that sought the surrender of the country’s largest paramilitary group, the AGC, and revived an individual demobilization program that plummeted the number of members of illegal armed groups taking part in demobilizations.Contradicting Defense Ministry statistics, the peace commissioner claimed this program was a success.Ceballos’ almost unprecedented talent to fail in every one of his duties has contributed to the rapidly deteriorating security situation, and an increase in armed conflict and human rights violations. armed conflictELNMiguel Ceballospeace commissioner ",https://colombiareports.com/the-tragicomic-ineptitude-of-colombias-peace-commissioner/,The tragicomic ineptitude of Colombia’s peace commissioner
" Human Rights Watch slammed Colombia’s government on Wednesday for failing to act against deadly violence that has killed more than 420 human rights defenders since 2016.In a report, the international human rights organization said “the authorities do not exercise effective control over several areas previously controlled by the FARC,” the former guerrilla group that demobilized in 2017.This government failure “has largely enabled violence against human rights defenders,” according to HRW, which stressed that particularly violence against native Colombian leaders was “disproportionately high.”The government has deployed troops to many areas, but has not strengthened the justice system at the same time or ensured adequate access to economic and educational opportunities, and public services.Human Rights WatchThe failures of the government of President Ivan Duque to provide basic services and implement the 2016 peace deal with the FARC “have significantly limited the government’s efforts to counteract the power of armed groups and prevent human rights violations,” the human rights organization said.HRW particularly decried the government’s refusal to continue the implementation of the peace deal’s proposed substitution of coca, the basic ingredient of cocaine, which put community leaders who have promoted this counternarcotics strategy at risk.It is fundamental the government takes meaningful steps to end this decades-long cycle of violence, which includes considering alternative approaches to drug policy that reduce the profitability of the drug trade.Human Rights WatchThe human rights organization additionally blasted the National Protection Unit, which is supposed to offer protection to threatened citizens, and other government agencies to respond to alerts issued by the government’s human rights office.The prosecution additionally admitted to identifying no more than 57 suspects in the 421 assassination investigations, stressed HRW. In 19 of the 34 conviction, the judge did not specify the motive of the murder.The human rights organization confirmed that Duque has failed to comply with his obligation to convene the so-called National Commission for Security Guarantees” which was conceived to formulate policies to dismantle illegal armed groups, particularly those sponsored by the private sector or in collusion with the security forces.The president’s Democratic Center party has opposed the peace process since it first entered Congress in 2014.

" Colombia’s mass media have been stigmatizing citizens who migrated to Venezuela for more than 15 years.According to Colombia’s migration agency, more than 1,729,000 Venezuelans migrated to Colombia in the past year.More than 500,000 Colombians additionally registered their return as they have been encouraged to do since 2012.The government of President Ivan Duque is concerned about how these migrants may vote in next year’s elections, however.The president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, refused to acknowledge the migrants’ existence while the country’s mass media portrayed them as traitors.The fear of the voting migrantNewspaper El Tiempo reported in November that the government was concerned abut the participation of almost 380,000 “Venezuelans” in “an alleged plan of the regime of Nicolas Maduro” to influence the 2022 elections.El Tiempo specified it wasn’t talking about Venezuelans, but the children of Colombians who have fled the neighboring country over the past seven years.The newspaper published statistics that were consistent with all 570,000 citizens who registered their return with the National Registry as they have been encouraged to do as as part of the “Colombia Nos Une” program since 2012.Colombians registering return from VenezuelaThe 380,000 referred to those Colombian citizens who will be allowed to vote unlike the approximately 3.5 million Colombians estimated to live in Venezuela.Maduro cut off all diplomatic ties and Colombians’ possibility to vote from abroad in February 2018 after Duque facilitated an opposition attempt to oust his Venezuelan counterpart.The subsequent tensions spurred a reported surge of ethnic violence against Colombians in Venezuela and the return of migrants who are now met with suspicion and stigmatization at home.The crime of leaving of ColombiaThis origin of the distrust of migrants can be traced back to 2004 when Venezuela’s late President Hugo Chavez sought to give undocumented immigrants voting rights ahead of an August 2004 recall referendum.According to Chavez, his “Mission Identity” would allow some 1.5 million undocumented immigrants, mostly alleged victims of Colombia’s armed conflict, to request an identity card that came with voting rights in February 2004.“Approximately one million Colombians were able to receive their Venezuelan ID cards thanks to Mission Identity kicked off” by the Venezuelan President “to obtain support in the recall referendum,” according to far-right newspaper El Colombiano in February 2005.El Tiempo reported in March that year that, according to the migration authority in Caracas, 186 thousand of the 595 thousand Colombians who had signed up for legalization “enjoy Venezuelan nationality.”The political patron of Maduro never needed the immigrants’ votes; Chavez won the referendum with a 2 million-vote lead.The alleged refugees were convenient to discredit Uribe, who was a fierce critic of Chavez’s “Bolivarian Revolution” and an outspoken supporter of Venezuela’s opposition.Colombian media’s subsequently stigmatized the migrants by falsely claiming they were Chavez’ electoral tool or given Venezuelan nationality.When Duque’s political patron left office in 2010, the Colombian government acknowledged the migration to Venezuela of no more than 100 thousand Colombians since 1997.According to one of the government’s latest conspiracy theories, the Colombians who returned from Venezuela are now a potential threat to democracy. 2022 electionsarmed conflictdisplacementmigrationVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/duques-fear-for-colombias-migrant-votes/,Duque’s fear for Colombia’s migrant votes
" Colombia’s new defense minister asked mayors for financial support on Wednesday to add 21,000 men and women to the National Police before the end of next year.According to Defense Minister Diego Molina, the “Segments for Life” strategy seeks to “strengthen police action in places where there is excessive crime.”To do this, Molano said he would immediately order 7 thousand cops who are currently doing desk duties to carry our street patrols and together with 5,000 cadets expected to graduate this year.Recovering from ELN attackThe recruitment of another 15,000 new officers next year would return the total number of policemen to 180,000, the police force Colombia had before the ELN plunged the National Police in crisis.A guerrilla car bomb killed 22 police cadets in the General Santander police academy in Bogota in January 2019.How terrorism works | Part 1: Colombia’s ELN guerrillasSix months after the attack, 39,000 officers had resigned from the National Police, which was unable to recruit new cadets after the traumatic terrorist attack.Two years after the ELN attack, the police still is 20,000 men and women short to reach the 180,000 officers that made up the force before the guerrillas dealt one of their biggest blows to the police in history.At the current speed, Molano and the police will need almost four years to recover from the attack that did not just kill the cadets, but left the institution undermanned for years.To complicate matters further, the defense minister asked mayors to chip in to provide the financial incentives for new recruits that would allow Molano to meet his target.Molano the man for the job?Whether Molano, a business administrator, will be able to pull the National Police and the National Army out of their respective crises begs the question.The former chief of staff of President Ivan Duque has no experience in public security or national defense, and expressed more interest in to his political party, the far-right Democratic Center, than the security challenges Colombia is facing as a consequence of the coronavirus and the increased violence by illegal armed groups. defense ministryDiego MolanoNational Police ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-new-defense-minister-asks-mayors-for-money-to-recruit-police/,Colombia’s defense minister asks mayors for money to recruit police

" Buenaventura, Colombia’s biggest port city on the Pacific coast, will always be subjected to mafia terror until “the state takes control for once,” according to the mayor.This would be a novelty, according to Mayor Victor Hugo Vidal, a former community leader who has been demanding an end to state neglect for years.Vidal’s 2019 election triggered a violent offensive against local authorities from organized crime group “La Local” without any response from President Ivan Duque or his cabinet.What may be Colombia’s biggest drug trafficking hub somehow is not and never had been a priority in Bogota.The latest of countless turf warsLa Local stopped fighting the mayor in December when the organized crime group split into two rival factions.Since then, Buenaventura’s 500,000 residents have been terrorized by  violence between “Los Shotas” and “Los Espartanos,” according to several authorities.“Since the split of La Local, the two structures have increased their pressure on children, teenagers and young adults to join one of the two sides,” the national human rights office said in formal warning last week.The rupture in La Local occurred even before the organized crime group was able to expel or exterminate “La Empresa,” which used to control the port city.On the outskirts of the city, ELN guerrillas, paramilitary group AGC and dissidents of demobilized rebel group FARC have been vying for control of drug trafficking routes to the port and coastal swamps.Mandatory silenceThe latest turf war has destroyed what was left of the local economy while the gangs, the guerrillas and the paramilitaries prey on the starving locals.Buenaventura’s residents are unable to speak about the latest turf war as the gangs disputing Buenaventura’s urban area, its port and its criminal rackets made it clear that anyone opening their mouth will be killed.The only people who are able to talk about the situation are locals who have fled the port city and an occasional human rights defender.Several armed men arrived in the area at night, they were hooded and with weapons. They entered the area through the back of my house, I imagine from the creek that flows to the open sea. These people killed two boys, apparently from another gang. The days following the attack these people returned and some of them went into several houses in the sector and threatened the inhabitants to make sure we would not say anything, they took over the neighborhood and threatened to kill anyone who said anything, so we decided to leave.Displaced residentThe streets are disputed by the illegal armed actors and the community can’t say a thing. From 4 or 5 o’clock in the afternoon the doors of the houses have to be closed. That is the reality we are living today.Human rights defender Orlando CastilloNo news from BogotaThe mayor has been lobbying Bogota for investment to boost the local economy since he took office in January last year, but without success.Vidal spent his life enduring Buenaventura’s perpetual cycles of violence and can guess how the latest will end.The gangs reach an agreement, one of the parties wins the fight or the State takes control of the situation for once.Mayor Victor Hugo VidalLocal human rights defender Orlando Castillo, the local ombudsman and conflict analyst Juan Manuel Torres agree that Buenaventura will never be able to live in peace unless the national government ends its historic neglect and invests in the city.“Before the pandemic, unemployment was 75%, but this number has increased,” Buenaventura ombudsman Edwin Patiño told newspaper El Espectador, who stressed the city’s youth were easy pickings for either gangs or illegal armed groups unless they have food or a job.More than police reinforcements, we need social intervention. The high unemployment rate has become a key point for criminals because young people are unemployed.Buenaventura ombudsman Edwin PatiñoColombia’s failing state | Part 1: Antioquia and the art of decapitation“As long as there is no serious and responsible intervention, we will have to continue living with violence,” according to Castillo.“Especially with the pandemic, when there is less food on the table, people are hungry and there is a level of hopelessness and a loss of freedoms that are uncontrollable because of the violence,” Torres told El Espectador.The mayor wrote the president last week to requesting urgent support, stressing that “we don’t want criminals, but legitimate authorities to determine what happens in Buenaventura.”Duque, who was elected in 2018 with the help of the mafia, has yet to respond.

" Colombia’s former President Juan Manuel Santos asked US President Joe Biden to reverse a decision to designate Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism.Santos made the requested on behalf of The Elders, a group of leaders “working together for peace, justice and human rights” founded by late South African President Nelson Mandela.According to Colombia’s former president, the decision of the US’ former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to designate the Caribbean nation state as a state terrorism sponsor violated “the principle that no state should face negative repercussions for helping to facilitate peace agreements.”Pompeo put Cuba on the terrorism sponsor list last year, citing the communist Caribbean state’s refusal to extradite peace negotiators of the Colombian guerrilla group ELN to Bogota.US further complicates prospects for peace in ColombiaThe extradition request by the government of President Ivan Duque violated international agreements that allowed the beginning of peace talks with the ELN in 2017.Duque suspended these talks after taking office in August 2018 and demanded the extradition of the peace negotiators after an ELN guerrilla killed more than 70 police cadets in a terrorist attack in January 2019.On behalf of The Elders, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate said to “unequivocally reject the decision” of Pompeo and said Biden “should immediately begin the review process to overturn this.”Cuba should be applauded for the crucial role it played in helping to end decades of conflict and facilitating reconciliation in Colombia, not face sanctions for having done so. Countries which facilitate peace processes deserve our thanks and appreciation.Former President Juan Manuel SantosThe former president’s request was met with fierce criticism from Duque’s far-right Democratic Center (CD) party, which has consistently opposed peace talks with the ELN and a peace process that followed successful talks between Santos and the now-defunct FARC guerrilla group.Santos won’t hold back in his support of criminals and dictatorships that protect them.

" Colombia’s new defense minister Diego Molano kicked off his first day in office on Saturday negating the security threat posed by political violence.In his first speech, Molano confirmed public concerns that the business administrator is loyal to the controversial Democratic Center party above all else.The defense minister’s negation of the violence against people involved in the implementation of a 2016 peace deal with former FARC guerrillas is similar to that of his predecessor, former Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, who died of COVID-19 last month.Like Trujillo, the far-right loyalist of former President Alvaro Uribe has regularly stigmatized or criminalized government critics, which is what incites most violence, according to social organizations.The so-called Uribistas’ verbal aggression has become a constant in the so-called Democratic Center party of which at least three leading members started their political career under the wings of the Medellin Cartel and many have been associated with far-right death squads.Colombia’s government “inciting violence” against former rebels: UNMolano falsely claimed that drug traffickers pose the biggest threat to social leaders, which allows the minister to continue his predecessor’s ineffective counternarcotics policy.The government’s refusal to implement the peace deal or effectively provide public security where needed has plunged Colombia’s countryside in a gradually worse security crisis since the president took office in 2018.The defense minister’s lack of relevant experience and failure to understand his job would provide little hope he will be less inept than his late predecessor who saw massacres almost quadruple in the year he was in office.Uribe’s alleged criminal activity and financial sponsors of the Democratic Center who have been accused of involvement in crimes against humanity give the Uribistas a good reason to oppose the peace process, and the war crimes tribunal in particular as many of them could disappear behind bars. defense ministryDiego Molano ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-new-defense-minister-kicks-off-first-day-negating-political-violence/,Colombia’s new defense minister kicks off first day negating political violence
" Multinational Glencore’s subsidiary in Colombia said Thursday that it will abandon its mining interests amid dropping profits, and growing human rights and environmental concerns.In a press release, Glencore subsidiary Prodeco announced it will return its mining titles in La Guajira, where the company partly owns Colombia’s largest coal mine, and the neighboring Cesar province.The Glencore subsidiary said it would only keep its interest in “Puerto Nuevo,” a coal exports port close to the Caribbean city of Santa Marta.Glencore’s mounting problemsThe announcement comes amid indigenous protests in La Guajira and weeks after human rights organizations asked the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to investigate environmental concerns.Prodeco was already facing possible legal consequences over its role in paramilitary violence and land theft.According to the company, however, the global economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic dropped commodity prices below a point that its mining operations were no longer profitable.How a village called ‘United States’ only just survived Colombia’s armed conflictThe last months The United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, David Boyd, urged the Colombian government to order Prodeco, AngloGold Ashanti and BHP to suspend operations in the Cerrejon mine, the country’s largest open-pit coal mine that is located in La Guajira.According to Colombia’s Constitutional Court, the multinationals’ mining operations pose an unacceptable health threat to the Wayuu people, who have inhabited La Guajira for thousands of years.Prodeco additionally requested a suspension of activity of its mines in Cesar, La Jagua and Calenturitas, which was turned down by the country’s National Mining Agency (ANM) in December last year.Last month, human rights advocates asked the OECD to investigate Glencore and its international partners over alleged environmental damage caused in La Guajira.Indigenous blocked roads and the railroad connecting the Cerrejon mine to its port near Santa Marta earlier this week to demand increased autonomy.The accumulation of events in Colombia and the global economic crisis spurred Glencore to give up on its mining operations in the South American country.City hall says central Colombia town in crisis after mining ban, locals say economy picked upOther miners concerned over Glencore’s departureLocals in La Guajira and Cesar are unlikely to mourn Glencore’s departure unlike the national government, which will have to do without the royalties of Prodeco.The Glencore subsidiary’s mining activity amounted to more than 20% of Colombia’s coal production and added approximately $85 million (COP300 billion) in royalties to the national treasury each year, according to the National Mining Association (ACM).The miners’ association said it regretted Prodeco’s decision and called on the government of President Ivan Duque to come up with measures that would alleviate the sector, which is suffering the consequences of the coronavirus just like most other sectors.In a statement, the ACM said the mining industry “generates employment, development and social welfare,” a claim disputed by communities that live in the vicinity of mines throughout Colombia. glencoreminingProdeco ",https://colombiareports.com/glencore-to-abandon-mining-in-colombia-amid-growing-woes/,Glencore to abandon mining in Colombia amid growing woes

What is certain is that Duque was referring to drug traffickers, not the guerrillas who have been making major territorial advances..Whether the president was being creative or just nostalgic about the now-defunct Medellin Cartel, Duque additionally referred to the group of dissident guerrilla leader “Ivan Marquez” as “Narcotalia.”Duque’s favorite fantasiesMarginal FARC dissident group poses major security threat from VenezuelaVenezuela and Cuba want to rig Colombia’s 2022 electionsOpposition movement infiltrated by Venezuelan President Ivan MaduroRussia is spying on stuff“Narco-terrorism”Government will arrest drug traffickersThroughout the weekend, the president couldn’t stop talking about the “narco-terrorists” of the ELN and Marquez, conveniently ignoring Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, is a former cartel associate who is under investigation for his alleged complicity in multiple massacres.Government-loyal weekly Semana and newspaper El Tiempo published the latest unsubstantiated claims of intelligence agency DNI about Marquez’ alleged location in Venezuela and an alleged rift in the ELN.The DNI has been stepping up force-feeding the media of allegedly corrupt bankers Luis Carlos Sarmiento and Jaime Gilinski all kinds of unsubstantiated “intelligence” that would confirm Duque’s conspiracy theories leftist governments are out to get him and his far-right Democratic Center party.Colombia’s corporate media taking part in possibly illegal intelligence operationsThe president’s conspiracy theories may be more comforting than the thought his party may get an electoral beating in 2022 over alleged mafia interference to rig the 2018 elections in Duque’s favor.The would almost certainly be more comforting than 23 human rights defenders and community leaders who have been assassinated and the 13 massacres in which 45 people were slain.Duque’s refusal to implement a 2016 peace deal former FARC guerrillas and the president’s imploded security policy have spurred a dramatical increase in political and drug-related violence and has isolated the president and alleged mafia puppet.While Duque has been trying to entertain himself with conspiracy theories, a growing number of people refer to Mockingly refer to the alleged mafia puppet as the “Worst President in History” amid growing concerns about the future of Colombia.

" Efforts of Colombia’s prosecution to jail the policemen who discovered that President Ivan Duque’s far-right party conspired with the mafia to rig the 2018 elections suffered a major setback on Wednesday.The Bogota superior tribunal revoked a lower court’s decision to detain Major Yefferson Tocarruncho and Sergeant Wadith Velasquez, claiming the prosecution had no evidence to sustain claims the investigators were illegally wiretapping colleagues.Controversial prosecutor Daniel Hernandez, who has allegedly covered up of some of Colombia’s biggest corruption scandals, had requested the cops’ arrest based on nothing but suppositions, according to the court.Is Daniel Hernandez Colombia’s most corrupt prosecutor in history?According to Hernandez, the policemen who discovered that the Democratic Center (CD) party conspired with the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa to rig the 2018 elections, illegally wiretapped colleagues.The Bogota court slammed the prosecutor for ignoring the testimony of one of Figueroa’s subordinates, “La Penca,” who admitted to deceiving the investigators in May 2018 in an apparent attempt to undermine their investigation.At the time, the investigators were investigating one of Figueroa’s money launderers, Jose Guillermo Hernandez a.k.a. “El Ñeñe,” as part of a murder investigation.While being wiretapped, El Ñeñe conspired extensively with the personal assistant of former President Alvaro Uribe and allegedly other party officials to rig the elections in Duque’s favor.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersThe revelation of this evidence triggered the Supreme Court to open a third criminal investigation into Uribe while the prosecution was supposed the alleged involvement of CD officials.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, one of Duque’s best friends, ordered to persecute the cops who discovered the president’s narco ties instead of the elections fraud scandal.Barbosa’s own involvement in the campaign spurred the chief prosecutor to delete his social media accounts in an attempt to desperately save whatever was left of his reputation.The prosecutors trying to make Colombia’s 2018 election rigging plot go awayWhile the cops were being detained, the journalists who discovered additional evidence the president was friends with a mafia figure began receiving death threats.Everything went well until it didn’t, which anyone with a law degree could have figured.The cops’ exoneration and Barbosa’s increasingly desperate attempts to protect his allegedly criminals friends are going  wrong to the extent Colombia’s chief prosecutor could end up in prison.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque appointed his former chief of staff, Diego Molano, as defense minister on Tuesday.Molano, one of the far-right president’s closest allies, will replace Carlos Holmes Trujillo, who died of COVID-19 last week.The new defense minister has been an outspoken supporter of Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, and a critic of the Supreme Court after it ordered Uribe’s detention last year.Molano, a business administrator, has no experience in matters related to defense or national security, but was in charge of talks with the leaders of the 2019 anti-government protests, the largest in more than four decades.The new defense minister additionally joined his late predecessor to coordinate a response to protest against police brutality that resulted in the Bogota Massacre during which police murdered 13 people in September last year.Molano, who is now in charge of the military as well as the police, inherits major challenges from Trujillo as the future of the Colombian government’s security and defense policies is uncertain.Following the demobilization of the FARC, Colombia’s largest guerrilla group until 2017, a multitude of illegal armed groups began vying for control over the countryside.After since office in August 2018, Duque has been reluctant to implement the peace deal with the now-defunct FARC and prioritized a military offensive to curb booming cocaine production.The National Army and the National Police, however, found themselves weakened by corruption and have been unable to provide basic security in the remote regions once controlled by the now-defunct FARC.Duque’s hardline counternarcotics policy was strongly supported by former US President Donald Trump, but has received no explicit endorsement from US President Joe Biden, who took office in January.Biden’s newly appointed Secretary Of State Antony Blinken did explicitly express his administration’s support for peace last week.Molano will have the mammoth task of developing and executing security and defense policies that are in line with Duque’s hardline agenda without risking US military support. defense ministryDiego Molanoexecutive orderpublic security ",https://colombiareports.com/duques-former-chief-of-staff-replaces-colombias-late-defense-minister/,Duque’s former chief of staff replaces Colombia’s late defense minister
" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his “strong support for peace in Colombia” in his first phone call to his Colombian counterpart Claudia Blum on Thursday.A press release by Blinken’s spokesperson Ned Price made it clear that US President Joe Biden’s priorities would require major policy changes from his far-right Colombian counterpart Ivan Duque.The secretary of state said the US government will help Bogota “as it extends the benefits of peace throughout the country” and ensures “the protection of human rights.”UN calls on Colombia to curb ‘appalling and pervasive violence’Duque has refused to implement key elements of a 2016 peace deal with demobilized FARC guerrillas and has shown little interest to curb the deterioration of human rights in Colombia.Blinken said he would support Duque to “defeat the narcotraffickers and transnational criminal groups,” but ignored the Colombian government’s policy to forcibly eradicate coca, which was endorsed by Trump.The peace deal obliges Duque to develop public policies that would allow the dismantling of the illegal armed groups that are fueled by illegal activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining.Some, however, are close to the president’s far-right Democratic Center (CD) party and all justify Duque’s militaristic approach and his refusal to comply with the peace deal bartered by his predecessor, former President Juan Manuel Santos.Blinken’s failure to endorse Duque’s hardline policy and explicit endorsement for peace will require the Colombian president to implement policies that have been opposed by his party.Far-right Duque supporters say ‘we will finish’ one of Colombia’s worst massacresThe CD can count in little sympathy from the Biden administration, however, after its members and even government officials actively campaigned for Trump ahead of the US elections in November last year.The Colombian president now has the almost impossible task to make things right with Biden, who has so far failed to call Duque, without being rejected by his own party.Blum failed to mention Blinken’s explicit support for peace, but stressed a mutual agreement on the importance of restoring democracy in neighboring Venezuela and the reactivation of the economy that is in crisis due to the coronavirus.   Antony BlinkenClaudia Blumforeign relationsUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/duque-isolated-as-us-vows-strong-support-for-peace-in-colombia/,Duque isolated as US vows ‘strong support for peace in Colombia’

" The estimated net worth of Colombia’s richest men is much higher than what anyone allegedly reported to tax authority DIAN without this spurring an investigation.Questioning the wealth of billionaires Luis Carlos Sarmiento, Jaime Gilinski and Carlos Ardila is apparently as taboo as investigating evidence of previous allegation of criminal an terrorist activity.A 2019 book, Dynamics of Inequality in Colombia, inadvertently gave every reason to investigate the billionaires when it revealed that no Colombian had reported a fortune higher than $1.5 billion to the DIAN in 2017.Billionaires’ estimated wealth and highest net worth reported to tax officeThis came nowhere near the net worth of Colombia’s richest men estimated that year by Forbes, which estimated Sarmiento’s net worth at $12 billion that year.Based on Forbes’ estimate, the controversial banker should have contributed the equivalent of 0.4% of his wealth, or $44 million, to the treasury in 2017.The highest contribution received by DIAN for that year was only $766 thousand though, according to economist Luis Jorge Garay and Jorge Enrique Espitia, the authors of the book.This means that either Forbes’ estimates are unreliable, Colombia’s richest men are committing fraud that could land them in prison or both.Jaime Gilinski: Colombia’s ghost bankerFormer anti-corruption czar and the director of the Anti-Corruption Institute, Camilo Enciso, rang the alarm after reading the book last year, but was met with a deafening silence.If the numbers are correct, the best case scenario would be that Colombia’s two biggest bankers will be sent to prison to serve sentences between four to nine years.The worst case scenario would be that decades of ignoring evidence of Sarmiento and Gilinski’s alleged criminal activity could collapse Colombia’s entire financial system.In 2018, close to 3 million individuals declared Liquid Assets corresponding to the year 2017 close to a total of $894 billion (97% of the GDP of 2017, i.e. an average Net Worth per declarant of $298 million, with a maximum value of $4.6 billion and a minimum of zero (of $0).Dynamics of Inequality in ColombiaThe lesser of all evils may be to pretend the evidence indicating that Colombia’s financial system relies on criminals doesn’t exist, which the DIAN has been doing, presumably praying this won’t go wrong.If Sarmiento, Gilinski and Ardila do a better job than Pablo Escobar in pretending to be legitimate businessmen they may be prevent causing more destruction than the slain drug lord.If the controversial billionaires fail, the consequences are impossible to predict. economyfraudtaxes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-top-bankers-could-face-4-years-in-prison-but-evidence-of-tax-evasion-ignored/,"Colombia’s top bankers could face 4 years in prison, but evidence of tax evasion ignored"
" “We are happy!” the governor of Antioquia tweeted Monday, ignoring the decapitated head of a community leader found on the main square of a village in the north of the province two days before.Terrorism has been a major revenue generator for the businesses of the Gaviria family and still doesn’t seem to concern Governor Anibal Gaviria.The governor constructed apartment buildings over mass graves when he was mayor of Medellin and Gaviria’s alleged negligence plunged Antioquia in crisis before.The most brutal of fiveMiguel Barrientos from Yarumal became the fifth assassinated social leader in Antioquia in January alone, but was by far the most brutal, according to Antioquia Police commander Colonel Jorge Miguel Cabra.The police commander confirmed Barrientos’ head was found before the village church of Ochali.The rest of Barrientos’ body was found in a different village, however, and “showed gunshot wounds to the abdomen that initially caused his loss of his life,” according to Cabra.The police commander concluded that after assassinating the community leader “the criminals then decapitated him and threw his head in the village of Ochalí.”Death and happinessThe homicide and public display of the decapitated head “could be an act of intimidation of by illegal armed groups,” Yarumal’s Security Secretary Mauricio Restrepo redundantly told press.Restrepo claimed “he wasn’t a social leader” after confirming Barrientos was a member of one of Yarumal’s Community Action Boards.Mayor Miguel Peleaz doubled down on the denial, claiming Yarumal’s 34th homicide last month was “an isolated case.”Gaviria has ignored the assassination of all social leaders and the collapse of the state in the north of his province. The governor’s main catch phrase was “HAPPINESS” as he traveled south.Over the past three years, more than 1,200 people, including 60 social leaders, have been assassinated in northern Antioquia and across the border with the Cordoba province without any government response.Patron of Colombia’s president facing 19 years in prison over alleged terrorism and narco tiesThe state collapseDespite the presence of more than 4,000 members of the security forces, state neglect allowed a large number of illegal armed group to take control over the northern half of Antioquia.According to Yarumal mayor, “the information that exists is that FARC dissidents are present and at one point there was an incursion by another group, the Pachelly,” a faction of Medellin crime syndicate Oficina de Envigado.Paramilitary group AGC, guerrilla group ELN, and dissident EPL guerrillas are also active in Yarumal and the surrounding municipalities, according to independent observers.In the northeastern of Antioquia, “Los Caparrapos” are additionally active as law and order in the entire north of the province has all but folded like in many regions throughout Colombia.Paramilitaries shut down home turf in northern ColombiaWhy northern AntioquiaThe state collapse of northern Antioquia is mainly due because of chronic neglect as demonstrated by Gaviria, corruption and the region’s strategic importance for illegal armed groups.The Nudo de Paramillo mountain range on the border with Cordoba has been an important drug trafficking route for decades, and the Bajo Cauca region in the northeast is rich in gold.The disastrous counternarcotics strategy of President Ivan Duque has additionally boosted the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, throughout the north of the province.Colombia’s descent into violence is caused by factors that differ per region, but what appears to be a common factor is Duque’s reluctance to implement a 2016 peace agreement with former guerrilla group FARC.This is particularly a threat to governance in Antioquia where almost all of Duque’s political allies are suspected of crimes against humanity or ties with the now-defunct Medellin Cartel.

The government also invested in the the World Health Organization initiative Covax, which seeks to provide vaccines to poor countries.The National Vaccination Plan will first vaccinate first line healthcare workers and people older than 80, who have been given priority over less vulnerable groups.Regional authorities have been put in charge of locating people qualifying for the first vaccination drive.No dates for lower-priority vaccinationDuque and his health minister did not yet announce the beginning of the second stage of the vaccination drive as this depends on the arrival of shots from the different providers, which is proving more complicated than expected in the European Union.The second and subsequent stages of the vaccination drive seek to step up the number of shots per day after vaccinating 337,000 people in February.National Vaccination Plan schedule According to the health minister, the plan is to apply more than 3.3 million vaccines in March, 4.7 million in April, 3.9 million in May and 7.6 million in June as part of the first phase.Duque said that in the weeks previous to these mass vaccinations, authorities will be informing the public extensively about the progress to make sure everybody knows where and when to get his shot or shots.Preparations on their wayRuiz last week announced the locations where people will be able to get their vaccines after coordinating with regional authorities that will be in charge of effectively rolling out the vaccination campaign in their city or province.Some 2,800 healthcare workers from throughout Colombia has received special training in an attempt to make the unprecedented vaccination campaign go as smoothly as possible.The government has also been distributing refrigerators that will be necessary for the storage of the vaccines, of which the majority must be kept below freezing temperature. coronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-covid-vaccination-drive-to-kick-off-on-february-20/,Colombia’s COVID vaccination drive to kick off ‘on February 20’

" The death of Colombia’s defense minister on Tuesday severely disjointed the government of President Ivan Duque, which was already struggling with public security and the coronavirus.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo was not just the country’s defense minister, but also one of the most senior members of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center (CD) party and a long-time ally of the president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.Trujillo’s importanceLate Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo (L) and former President Alvaro UribeApart from the institutional consequences, the defense minister’s dying from COVID-19 is a tremendous blow for both the government and the ruling party of which Trujillo was a founding member.While widely considered inept, Trujillo wielded enormous power and was one of the main forces keeping Duque’s government in line with his far-right Democratic Center party after the resignation of former Interior Minister Alicia Arango in December.Uribe, the undisputed leader of the CD, was forced to resign from the senate in August last year after the Supreme Court placed him under house arrest on fraud and bribery charges.Duque’s allegedly criminal patron was able to have the house arrest revoked, but can not return to the senate and is now facing three criminal investigations.With Uribe out of the Senate and possibly wiretapped by the Supreme Court on election fraud suspicions, Arango in Geneva and Trujillo dead, Duque has run out senior “Uribistas” in his cabinet with the exception of Foreign Ministry Claudia Blum, who reportedly also wants to leave the cabinet.The Defense Minister was rumored he wanted to run for president next year for the “Uribistas,” who might want to prepare for an electoral train wreck because of the abysmal approval of both Duque and Uribe.The former president and former Medellin Cartel associate may have to team up with the notoriously corrupt Char Clan from Barranquilla to have any chance for cabinet positions and influence over the prosecution.Dodgy clans with mafia ties tighten grip on Colombia’s congressVaccination nervesWhile the country came out of its initial shock, criticism arose that if the Military Hospital couldn’t even save the defense minister’s life, what kind of healthcare ordinary Colombians may expect if they fall ill.Most urgently, voices suggested Trujillo may still be alive if controversial Health Minister Fernando Ruiz had been able to obtain vaccines earlier like other Latin American countries like Chile and Panama.Vaccine progress in the AmericasRuiz previously said he received one shipment from US manufacturer Pfizer and another from COVAX vaccines that has been developed with the coordination of the World Health Organization.Caracol Radio reported on Tuesday it had seen a draft decree specifying that the first Pfizer vaccines would arrive in the first week of February and that the COVAX vaccine wouldn’t arrive until March, later than promised.The first Pfizer batch would allow the vaccination of 1.7% of the population, but when the National Vaccination Plan would effectively kick off appears to be still unknown.Meanwhile, multiple pharmaceutical companies who have created vaccines against the coronavirus appear to be running into trouble to meet contractual obligations, particularly in Europe.National Vaccination Plan schedulePublic security crisisThe defense minister’s death came two days after the opposition asked to replace acting Defense Minister and Armed Forces commander General Luis Navarro for a civilian minister.Around the time of Trujillo’s death, the war crimes tribunal, Human Rights Watch and conflict analyst Ariel Avila ran the alarm that the public security policy of Duque and his late minister consisted mainly of holding press conference.Avila warned that Duque’s bungling of a peace process with demobilized FARC guerrillas and his failure to formulate a proper security policy had created the “perfect storm” that could result in a further escalation of violence later this year.Duque’s misrule: Colombia in ‘perfect storm’, heading towards ‘a river of blood’The late defense minister spent the entire last year boosting the notoriously ineffective forced eradication of coca and promoting the resumption of aerial spraying to stop the booming cocaine trade, but whether this made any sense won’t be known until June.Interdiction statistics from South America and Europe indicate that Colombia’s cocaine factories may have produced another record amount of the popular white powder last year while Duque’s promotion of corrupt Uribe allies in the security forces may have made the National Police and the National Army powerless if not major associates of drug traffickers.All this was already deteriorating when Trujillo was still alive. Whether Duque will be able to find a capable replace the late defense minister by someone from within his party, which has its roots in the Medellin Cartel, is entirely uncertain.The president is already widely considered Colombia’s worst ever president.

" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal is set to charge eight former commanders of demobilized guerrilla group FARC for kidnapping, local media reported Wednesday.The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) will additionally charge the commanders for their alleged responsibility in the “taking of hostages and grave deprivation of liberty” of thousands of people.The charges are considerably more serious and explicit than the initial investigation into the “illegal retention of people by the FARC,” considered a euphemism that insulted victims by many.The JEP also sought to try “Bertulfo Alvarez,” but this former guerrilla leader died on Tuesday.

" Colombia’s former FARC guerrillas voted to no longer use the abbreviation of their now-defunct guerrilla group as the name of their political party.The demobilized rebels voted to change their political party’s name to “Comunes” (Commons) a year ahead of their second participation in national elections.The former FARC members decided to maintain the abbreviation of their former guerrilla group when they formed their political party in 2017 as part of an ongoing peace process.Dissidents also laid claim to the name used by the guerrillas since 1964, however, which created confusion about the FARC’s political party and the armed groups that rejected or abandoned the peace process.By changing name of their political party, the former rebels also disassociate themselves from the “glorious Revolutionary Armed forces of Colombia” (FARC), which is still considered a foreign terrorist organization by the US Government.The change in name was proposed by the FARC’s former military commander Rodrigo Londoño, a.k.a. “Timochenko,” ahead of the leftist political party’s second assembly.According to the political party’s director, the original decision to call the former guerrillas’ political party FARC “was not the best thing to do.”Reality showed that it was not the best thing to do. I hope that in this second extraordinary assembly of the party, for life, for peace with social justice, the members will debate this issue and we will change the name of the party.Rodrigo LondoñoThe former guerrillas’ political party will be guaranteed five seats in the Senate and five in the House of Representatives despite the outcome of the 2022 elections.The former guerrillas will lose their guaranteed political participation after these elections, however, and will have to maintain their seats through votes like any other political party.The political future of Comunes is additionally threatened by ongoing violence targeting former FARC members as well as community leaders supporting the peace process that seeks to end an armed conflict of more than half a century. 2022 electionsComunesFARCpeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-demobilized-guerrillas-abandon-farc-brand/,Colombia’s demobilized guerrillas abandon FARC brand
" International responses to the death of Colombia’s defense minister on Tuesday were warm, but political vultures are lurking from the sky and lobbyists are seeking inroads.Radical critics of Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, who died of health complications due to COVID-19 on Tuesday, refused to allow the family to grief in peace with vile attacks on social media.Think tanks and lobbyists from Colombia and the United States glorified the controversial defense minister, but refused to acknowledge the existence of victims of human rights violations allegedly committed with the complicity of the late minister.The responses polarized social media, mainly Twitter, where citizens, politicians and DC insiders were taking part in the public debate.Politicizing a tragedyColombia’s congressional opposition unanimously expressed its remorse over the defense minister’s passing, but was unable to curtail resentment against Trujillo by its more radical supporters.One exiled citizen called the late defense minister of President Ivan Duque a “massacring terrorist” in reference to Trujillo’s alleged complicity in a massacre of 13 people in the capital Bogota last year and staggering increase in massacres since the defense minister took office in November 2019.Others called Trujillo an “enemy of the people,” compared the late defense minister with late Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels or remembered the ties between the late minister’s father and now-defunct drug lord Pablo Escobar.The defense minister’s death spurred Duque to declare a three-day mourning period for Colombia’s COVID deaths “including our defense minister,” which was distorted by some government opponents who falsely claimed the honor was meant exclusively for Trujillo.We have been in mourning since Ivan Duque took office.Confecciones la MontañaDC praiseBecause of the late Defense Minister’s controversial CV and human rights records, most foreign responses were moderate, with the exception of the US Government, the Venezuelan opposition and Washington DC-based NGO’s that rely on federal and corporate spending.US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the late minister was “a patriot, defender of democracy, and partner to the United States,” going as far as claiming that Trujillo “enhanced regional security and well-being.”The diplomatic flattery was the most significant since US President Joe Biden took office after visible misgivings over support by Colombian government officials for former President Donald Trump in last year’s elections.Matt Swift of  the Concordia Summit, an organization close to the Organization of American States (OAS), said the late defense minister “was a remarkable leader, defender of freedom, and a genuinely good man. He served Colombia with great distinction.”The Americas Society/Council of the Americas, another DC think tank, said Trujillo “served his country faithfully for decades and was generous in sharing his wisdom and insights with us.”According to the Latin America Center of the Atlantic Council lobby group, “Trujillo was a champion for multilateralism and for the US-Colombia relationship, as well as an advocate for democracy in Venezuela. A remarkable leader and person.”Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, whose political future has become uncertain, called Trujillo an “invaluable human being, a loyal supporter of democracy and a great Colombian.”Moderate responsesOrganizations monitoring human rights and Colombia’s peace process were considerably more stand-offish than the DC stakeholders.United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric politely expressed gratitude to the late defense minister “for having been an important support” to observers of the peace process “and the UN Country Team.”The European Union’s ambassador in Colombia said Trujillo was “a great man with whom the European constructed a lot. I am overcome by sadness to lose a friend.”“Despite the differences we’ve had, he always maintained a frank, open, productive and above all very humane dialogue with me,” Americas Director Jose Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights Watch said.Latin America director of the International Crisis Group, Ivan Briscoe, sent “deep condolences” and called Trujillo “a  statesman and a true friend of” his NGO.Human rights NGO Washington Office on Latin America made no public statement on the passing of Colombia’s defense minister.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque congratulated his American counterpart Joe Biden on assuming the presidency after alleged election meddling all but froze bilateral relations.In a video message, Duque said “we wish you the best, we wish you success and we celebrate your speech.”The Colombian president stressed that Biden’s speech invited to “construct common goals in the midst of difference” in an apparent reference to tensions between the two historical allies.The newly sworn in American president has yet to call Duque whose far-right political party and government have been accused of supporting the campaign of former President Donald Trump ahead of elections in November last year.The Colombian president stressed that his government “is ready to continue strengthening a historic relationship.”We reiterate what has been a historic relationship, which is close to turning 200 years.President Ivan DuqueWhat shape or form bilateral relations will have is uncertain until Biden stops giving Duque the cold shoulder.In a brief statement on the immediate priorities of the United States’ 46th president, the White House said Biden would seek to “restore America’s standing in the world” and be “rebuilding democratic alliances across the globe, championing America’s values and human rights.”Colombia’s ambassador to Washington DC, Francisco Santos, followed up by stressing “shared values” and Bogota’s “commitment to democracy, rule of law and a respect for human rights.”The Colombia-U.S. relationship is more than a partnership; it is a friendship built on a foundation of shared values – our commitment to democracy, rule of law and a respect for human rights.Colombian embassy in Washington DCSantos allegedly campaigned for Trump though and may have to resign so Biden can “restore America’s standing in the world” and make it clear that the US government will allow no meddling in election.Biden is unlikely to drop his government’s historically staunch ally in Latin America, but Duque may have to prove his government’s self-proclaimed “commitment to democracy, rule of law and a respect for human rights.” diplomacyforeign relationsIvan DuqueJoe BidenUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/duque-praises-biden-amid-uncertain-future-of-us-colombia-relations/,Duque praises Biden as future of US-Colombia relations remains uncertain
" President-elect Joe Biden wants to end the United States’ so-called “War on Drugs,” which may force Colombia’s President Ivan Duque to drastically revise domestic drug policies.Duque gladly returned to the hardline stance on drug use and drug trafficking promoted by his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, after taking office in 2018.Despite the counterproductive results, Colombia’s president could count on the support of his outgoing American counterpart Donald Trump.In fact, Duque has been trying to resume the controversial aerial spraying of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, ever since Trump took office in 2018, but without success.‘Tensions between US and Colombia over counternarcotics disaster’The president proudly stated that the security forces eradicated a record 130,000 hectares of coca and confiscated more than 500 tons of cocaine last year, but received no recognition.The US Embassy in Bogota is visibly in transition and Biden has been an outspoken supporter of more liberal drug policies like the ones promoted by former President Juan Manuel Santos, the political nemesis of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party.Duque unsuccessfully sought to criminalize marijuana while Biden’s pre-election “Unity Task Force” considered this part of “the misguided and racist federal war on drugs and the systematic criminalization of poverty.”The US president’s elect’s think tank recommended to “increase support for accountable efforts to combat global organized crime responsible for human and drug trafficking,” but also said that “it is past time to end the failed ‘War on Drugs’, which… hasn’t been effective in reducing drug use.”Colombia admits $22 billion US counternarcotics strategy failedThis puts Biden in the corner of Colombia’s congressional opposition, which has been seeking legislation to end Duque’s repressive policies that failed to reduce drug trafficking, but did provide the government with American money to repress opposition.Instead, the opposition wants the government to implement the 2016 peace deal with demobilized FARC guerrillas that includes a counternarcotics policy based on the economic empowerment of farmers.This peace deal is opposed by Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party, but can count on the support of the US Congress and former US President Barack Obama, the president-elect’s former boss.Besides, Colombia’s president may pretend cocaine is the root of all violence in his country, but the popular white powder is nowhere near a priority for Biden, whose country is dealing with a brutal drug epidemic caused by opioids.If Duque wants to continue his repressive drug policy, he would have to do so without domestic support and possibly without the money of American tax payers. counternarcoticsDrug policyJoe BidenUnited Stateswar on drugs ",https://colombiareports.com/joe-biden-and-colombia-part-2-ending-the-war-on-drugs/,Joe Biden and Colombia | Part 2: ending the ‘War on Drugs’
" Residents of Colombia’s three largest cities woke up to another weekend-long curfew on Saturday as the coronavirus has hospitals on the brink of collapse.The curfew took force a day after a new strain of the virus that was discovered in Brazil spurred the country’s migration agency to remain its land borders closed until March 1.A travel ban from the United Kingdom, where another new strain of the coronavirus caused a surge in infections, remains in place as well as mandatory COVID-19 tests for incoming travelers.Record COVID infectionsThe country’s Health Ministry on Friday registered 21,078 new infections, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic.The 377 confirmed deaths made Friday one of the deadliest since CIOVID was formally confirmed in Colombia on March 6 last year.Registered COVID casesMayors in charge of decentralized measuresThe mayors of the capital Bogota and Colombia’s two largest cities, Medellin and Cali, issued weekend-long curfews to prevent their saturated hospital systems from collapsing.These three cities alone are home to more than a quarter of the country’s population.President Ivan Duque said earlier this week he would extend a “selective lockdown,” which authorizes mayors to take extreme measures like curfews, until February 28.The decentralized measure allow mayors and governors to respond to outbreaks depending on local situation, but severely complicates monitoring the situation on a national level.Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said earlier this week her city was at the top of a second infection peak and Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero said he hoped this weekend’s curfew would be the last.At first we felt invincible, wise and arrogant, but with time we understood the truth; sickness and death walk with us, hidden, waiting for carelessness to take away our patient and life itself.Colombian Medical College chairman Rodrigo IsazaHealth minister focused on vaccination driveWhile mayors are trying to keep their municipal healthcare systems from collapsing, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz has been in charge of rolling out the biggest vaccination campaign in Colombia’s history.The decentralized nature of the country’s healthcare system is causing concern among mayors of the country’s poorer parts of the country who fear they will be left behind in the national campaign.Ruiz wants to begin vaccinating the elderly and healthcare personnel nationally in February, but the chairman of the National Federation of Municipalities (FNM) on Friday asked to amend the decree coordinating this campaign.FNM chairman Gilberty Toro said Friday that the majority of mayors lack the funds to buy vaccines. Consequently, “some will be able to acquire them and others will not,” according to Toro.Opening up the possibility of purchasing vaccines by local authorities would generate competition between territorial entities with greater or lesser capacity to generate their own resources.FNM chairman Gilberto ToroAhead of the vaccination campaign set to kick off in February, the national government has embarked on a major propaganda campaign that seeks to combat skepticism and disinformation about vaccines. coronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-main-cities-shut-down-as-covid-threatens-to-collapse-healthcare/,Colombia’s main cities shut down as COVID threatens to collapse healthcare
" Colombia’s prosecution asked a Bogota court on Wednesday to revoke an indictment on fraud and bribery charges against former President Alvaro Uribe.Controversial prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes said he supported the former president’s writ that asked the Bogota Superior tribunal to revoke a ruling of a lower court to uphold the Supreme Court’s 2018 indictment.The allegedly criminal patron of President Ivan Duque resigned from the Senate in August last year to end a Supreme Court investigation after being placed under house arrest.The high court agreed to forward the investigation to a lower court after Uribe renounced on his congressional privileges.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, one of Duque’s best friends, appointed the fringe prosecutor to take up the case.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonIndicted despite the prosecutionAn arraignment judge agreed to lift Uribe’s detention, but an appeals court decided in November that the Supreme Court’s indictment against the former president remained in place.The ruling forced Jaimes to continue the criminal proceedings, which the far-right prosecutor didn’t.Uribe’s defense attorney Jaime Granados last week filed the writ, claiming that the appeals court judge’s decision violated the former president’s right to due process.Jaimes said that “the prosecution shares the constitutional concerns” of Uribe’s defense lawyer.The attorney of the victim of Uribe’s alleged witness tampering practices, opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, asked the court to uphold the indictment, claiming that the writ would only be applicable in the event “the suspect has exhausted all judicial means.”Why Colombia’s former president is accused of forming bloodthirsty death squadsThe blowbackUribe found himself investigated by the Supreme Court after it found evidence that the former president had bribed witnesses to sustain bogus criminal charges against Cepeda filed in 2014.Uribe resigned as the Senate leader of his Democratic Center party in panic, but changed his mind and allegedly tried to bribe more witnesses to beat the charges.When the court placed Uribe under house arrest, Duque’s patron left the senate for real in the hope to have a better changes if tried by the notoriously politicized prosecution.By then, however, the president was also being investigation for allegedly colluding with the mafia to rig the 2018 elections in favor of Duque, an investigation the Supreme Court refused to drop.Uribe has been tied to organized crime since he began his political career under the wings of the Medellin Cartel in the late 1970’s but was able to evade justice after his bogus charges against Cepeda went wrong.

The community is afraid because of the pamphlets, you can feel the fear in the streets and they are empty.Yirley VelascoWhile waiting for the latest government promise to be fulfilled, the leaders’ latest death threats told them that “people believing that a paramilitary group would never come to massacre you all again are wrong.”“We’re going to end the plague of rats that live in this community,” according to the people identifying themselves as the Aguilas Negras who have expressed their support for Duque.State convicted for “the worst massacre” in the history of Colombia’s armed conflictThe fun of terrorismAccording to the victims of the massacre, the paramilitaries who terrorized them had a lot of fun cutting them neighbors into pieces and raping their children.”To them, it was like a big party,” one of a dozen survivors told the New York Times three months after the massacre. ”They drank and danced and cheered as they butchered us like hogs.’Colombia’s media preferred to interview the fun-loving paramilitaries than gloomy victims. Dario Arizmendi gave paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño a 90-minute advertorial a few days after the massacre.It was perfectly easy to identify who were guerrillas, who were not, only when situations like these arose. But above all, I think it weakened a major evil. I believe that the tortures are horror stories, disinformation on the part of the witnesses in the area. No, to be tortured by the self-defense groups, that is a lie.AUC founder Carlos CastañoArizmendi has yet to interview Velasco about her horror stories about being raped by four men as a 14-year-old.Well, during that massacre they raped me. Four guys grabbed me, they beat me and they raped me. They told me to get on my knees and beg for my life, but I wouldn’t kneel. I told them I only knelt for God. They struck my knees, but weren’t able to take me down. The only thing I have left is the dignity of not kneeling for them, that the only way they could make me kneel was when I was already unconscious.Yirley VelascoApparently, “the novel impact of the paramilitary leader’s very presence allowed for public attention and the staging of a speech legitimizing the counter-insurgency war and its practices, as well as making the horrors committed by them invisible,” according to the National Center for Historical Memory.

" The COVID-19 pandemic has been a game-changer for Colombia’s cocaine trade and global counternarcotics efforts.While US president Donald Trump visited the Mexican border, authorities in the Netherlands said Tuesday they seized 47 metric tons of mainly Colombian cocaine in Rotterdam in 2020.Another 69 tons destined for Europe’s largest seaport were seized in South American ports, according to the Dutch border police.Cocaine seized en route to the NetherlandsBelgian customs officials said last week they seized a 64.4 tons in the port of Antwerp and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) intercepted another 25 tons destined for Antwerp.According to the UNODC, their agents in South American docks confiscated 105 tons, more than half of which was meant for Europe.Creative interpretationsAccording to the Dutch, the record seizures were “the result of increasingly smooth national and international cooperation.” The Belgians said “the drug gangs aren’t bothered” by the pandemic and adapted quickly.The cocaine seized in or en route to Rotterdam and Antwerp alone is almost 40% of cocaine seized in Colombia, according to President Ivan Duque who last week claimed at least 500 tons were confiscated last year.Cocaine seized in ColombiaMonths before Duque pretended confiscating more drugs than his country produced in 2014 was a success, German media were reporting about “the South American tsunami” that was stunning authorities.US in the dark about importsAmerican seizures of cocaine curiously dropped in 2020, according to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP).Contrary to Europe and South America, the US saw seizures contract almost 50%. The CPB could claim the drop in seizures is the consequence of effective counternarcotics like the Dutch claimed the increase is the consequence of effective counternarcotics, which would be ironic.Cocaine seized en route to the United StatesThe truth is nobody knows what is happening because calculating the sum of confiscated cocaine shipments is as easy as counting unnoticed drug imports is impossible.Securing three shorelines totaling more than 154 thousand kilometers with at least 60 seaports would be as difficult and expensive as going to the moon.While Trump was trying to build a wall on the Mexican border, narcos from Peru, the Dominican Republic and Brazil were sending shipping containers with mostly Colombian cocaine everywhere else.Mafia organizations from New York to the Balkans — and even employees of three Safeway stores outside of Seattle who swore they had ordered bananas — received massive amounts of cocaine for distribution.Law enforcement agencies across the globe were stunned to see their illegal economies thriving while the global economy tanked. coronavirusdrug trafficking ",https://colombiareports.com/what-covid-taught-colombia-about-cocaine-part-1-the-tsunami/,What COVID taught Colombia about cocaine | Part 1: the tsunami
" Colombia’s health ministry revealed the first specifics of the unprecedented campaign that seeks to vaccinate the country’s inhabitants against COVID-19.In a media presentation, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz revealed how he plans to roll out the campaign to vaccinate half of Colombia’s 50 million inhabitants against the virus that has killed more than 47,000 in the country over the past year.The presentation made it clear that the promised start of the campaign in February will be partly symbolic as the ministry doesn’t expect to the delivery of more than 850,000 vaccines in the first month.The government has secured the purchase of vaccines against the illness caused by the coronavirus for 29 million million people and is trying to have 35 million people vaccinated before the end of the year.Ruiz previously announced that the vaccination campaign will initially prioritize the elderly and health workers before rolling out the campaign to vaccinate the rest of the population.Because three of the government’s vaccines, AstraZeneca, Janssen and COVAX, have yet to be approved by health authorities, the Health Ministry will begin vaccinating with the Pfizer vaccine.The government bought 10 million vaccines from the American pharmaceutical company, which is enough to vaccinate five million people.The minister said he didn’t expect the Janssen vaccine to arrive until April or May. The producers of this vaccine reportedly hit a production obstacle, making it likely they won’t be able to produce their first batch in late February as projected.Ruiz warned that incidents like this could delay the delivery and vaccination process.The minister asked present media to actively counter disinformation about the COVID vaccines and vaccination in general to prevent people deciding against vaccination, which could put their health and the effectiveness of the entire campaign at risk.The vaccine will be available for both citizens and migrants, with the controversial exception of undocumented migrants whose exclusion would pose a similar risk as conspiracy theorists. coronavirusFernando ruizPublic health ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-reveals-first-specifics-of-covid-vaccination-campaign/,Colombia reveals first specifics of COVID vaccination campaign

This is closely linked to the pacts and the entire reactivation program where we have 450 projects and investments of $49.3  billion (COP173 trillion), some of them with public-private partnerships.Vice-President Marta Lucia RamirezThe government is under pressure from powerful business associations not to return to an economic shutdown like the one in March and April last year.At the same time, pressure is building about the government’s failure to provide vaccines that President Ivan Duque initially promised this month, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz last week promised for the second week of February without either being certain when these vaccines would arrive.In a letter to the minister, health organizations on Sunday demanded strategies be adapted to changing realities and stressed Ruiz failed to fulfil previous promises to expand the country’s intensive care and COVID testing capacities.Medical and health personnel in the first line of attention are decimated by exhaustion, the strenuous work days, the isolation and also by the painful increase of deaths due to contagion.Medical organizationsInspector General Fernando Carrillo additionally joined the health workers’ demand to fulfil promises to improve substandard labor conditions promised by Ruiz.Senator Roy Barreras additionally vowed he would file a motion of no confidence against the health minister’s resignation if Ruiz also failed to fulfill his promise to begin the national vaccination campaign in February. coronavirusMarta Lucia Ramirez ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-discards-new-covid-lockdown-as-new-surge-continues/,Colombia discards new COVID lockdown as new surge continues
" Colombia’s police are responsible for 289 homicides committed for which only two policemen were convicted since 2017, according to a local human rights group.The Police Violence Observatory of NGO Temblores obtained the information from the Medical Examiner’s Office, which determines people’s cause of death, newspaper El Espectador reported on Tuesday.The police would be responsible for 45% of murders committed by Colombia’s security forces in the three years studied by the NGO, according to El Espectador.Police murdersThe prosecution opened a criminal investigation in 103 of the 289 cases of which 101 never led to a conviction despite the fact that the medical examiner in all cases concluded the cause of death was murder.The numbers show that the police killings are a consistent practice, the NGO reportedly concluded.The failure to prosecute the killings leaves a lot of questions about the lawfulness of the police’s use of lethal force, however, according to Temblores.The police committed one murder every 3.8 days and almost two murders per week. It is necessary to ask ourselves why such high numbers of homicides are committed: are they the result of malicious behavior? are they the result of disproportionate use of force?TembloresThe Prosecutor General’s Office failed to respond to questions of El Espectador about the apparent negligence in legal action and the extremely low number of convictions, according to the newspaper.The prosecution has also yet to make any announcement about the prosecution of officers and commanders involved in a massacre in the capital Bogota in September last year when police indiscriminately opened fire on protesters, killing 13 people and leaving more than 60 people injured.The massacre took place while Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo was coordinating an operation to quell protests against rampant police brutality that in some parts of the city had turned violent. human rightsNational Policepolice brutalitypublic safety ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-police-responsible-for-289-murders-between-2017-and-2019-report/,Colombia’s police responsible for 289 murders between 2017 and 2019: report

" Colombia’s government neglect is impeding the country’s economic recovery as entrepreneurs are blacklisted by banks who are waiting for the approval of a grace period.Congress approved the “clean slate bill” in June last year already that would remove some 2 million Colombians from legal loan sharks’ blacklists, allowing them immediate access to financial services.The bill did not seek to waive any debt, but give people a 12-month grace period to pay off their debt and allow them to be removed from financial institutions” blacklist in a shorter period of time.Reactivating the economyCongress passed with the bill with urgency in June after the coronavirus and a month-long shutdown in April plunged Colombia’s economy in the worst crisis in history and many needed access to credit to restart their businesses.After the court remained quiet, one of the sponsors of the bill, right-wing House Representative Cesar Lorduy (Radical Change) filed an open information request to ask what was keeping the magistrates.The court responded that it never received the bill from Senate secretary Gregorio Pachecho and House secretary Jorge Humberto Mantilla. After verifying the filing and management procedure of this corporation, we established that the aforementioned matter has not yet been received by the Constitutional Court for its control and review.Constitutional CourtPoor banks and loansharksThe thing is that Colombia’s banks opposed the law, claiming that the removal of citizens from their blacklists would increase their risk, and the banks bankrolled President Ivan Duque’s election.Additionally, legal loan sharks like Datacredito saw their revenue plunge Colombians couldn’t even pay their debts because of the coronavirus.Datacredito’s revenue between 2019 and 2020Congress adds pressureUnder pressure from Congress, Pachecho and Mantilla finally sent the bill to the court in August.In December, Senators David Barguil (Conservative Party) and Luis Fernando Velasco (Liberal Party), who also sponsored the bill, said that the court had been waiting since September 1 because also the Interior Ministry failed to send information.This initiative is very important for the economic reactivation of Colombia and means hope for millions of citizens who, because of negative reports in the risk centers, have not been able to access the resources of the financial system.Senators David Barguil and Luis Fernando VelascoFinancial and economic institutions began to lower Colombia’s economic recovery projections as both exports and domestic consumption picked up slower than expected.The court still hasn’t been able to study the “clean slate bill”, but seven months after it was passed a light has emerged at the end of the tunnel and Colombia’s entrepreneurs might finally get access to resources.Interior Minister Alicia Arango, who may have believe “access to resources” referred to her husband’s alleged embezzlement of $500,000, resigned in December. bankscoronaviruseconomic recovery ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-degenerate-banking-system-vs-economic-recovery/,Colombia’s degenerate banking system vs. economic recovery
" Colombia’s second richest man, Jaime Gilinski, likes to avoid attention as the legitimacy of the country’s “nouveau riche” is questionable.The banking mogul and his family over the past decades constructed an intricate network of more than 100 banks and trust funds, many of which were carefully hidden from tax authorities in Colombia, the United States and Europe.Gilinski learned to lay low the hard way after the main office of his first bank, the Banco Andino, was reportedly caught moving money to corrupt politicians for the Cali Cartel in 1994.The creation of Bancolombia with the Antioquia Syndicate business cartel turned into a major legal battle with the Gilinski family who abandoned their share in 2010, after which stocks went up and the bank became Colombia’s largest.Meanwhile, Gilinski’s GNB Sudameris bank was sanctioned by Colombia’s financial watchdog 15 times on all kinds of charges between 2001 and 2013.Gilinski had branched out to the United States with the Eagle National Bank of Miami, which received a cease and desist order by the Federal reserve in 2005 over the Colombian banker’s alleged “parallel banking” practices.The key money laundering concern regarding parallel banking organizations is that the U.S. bank may be exposed to greater risk through transactions with the foreign parallel financial institution. Transactions may be facilitated and risks heightened because of the lack of arm’s-length dealing or reduced controls on transactions between banks that are linked or closely associated. For example, officers or directors may be common to both entities or may be different but nonetheless work together.Federal Financial Institutions Examination CouncilGilinski was able to sell the bank in 2009, ending his American dream, at least up north.In South America, the banker bought HSBC banks in Colombia, Peru, Paraguay and sought to set foot in Uruguay in 2012.“We shall continue to serve each client in each of the four countries with the same level of quality, profitability and efficiency that has been our trademark in the Colombian market,” said Gilinski.The next year, the banker bought a 5% share in Spain’s Banco de Sabanell, which bought a 5% share in Gilinski’s South American banks in 2015 in return.The risk of going above groundGilinski’s net worth had swollen to $3.5 billion by 2017, according to Forbes. His problems, however, had too.More than 27 years after the registration of Gilex Holding BV in the Netherlands, the parent company of GNB Sudameris moved to Luxembourg, the country with some of the strictest bank secrecy laws in Europe.According to the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, Gilinski Holding BV had a registered capital of $25,140 (€20,420) when it left the country on November 27, 2017.On that same day, Spain’s central bank announced to tighten regulations on Banco de Sabadell, which found itself in serious trouble over the April 2016 Panama Papers leak.The files of corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca revealed Sabanell’s shady dealings in the Central American country after the Colombian banker’s 2013 investment.One week later, Gilinski bragged to Forbes about the $1.4 billion he had made with “Panama Pacific,” which was dubbed “the most audacious real estate project in the world” by the financial publication.Until last year, Panama Pacific was nothing but an industrial complex in one of the Colombian banker’s favorite tax havens.Panama Pacific (Image: Google Earth)Sabadell reported to Spain’s financial watchdog that Gilinski sold 3% of the bank’s stocks under market value in November 2016, enough for the banker to avoid his assets being audited by the central bank.The market was happy to see Gilinski go. Sabadell’s stocks went up like those of Bancolombia six years before.(Image: Bloomberg)The police gets involvedGilinski learned soon that the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Parliament and international police organization Europol had opened investigations after he had evaded the Spanish central bank.Europol has compared the Panama Papers published by the ICIJ with its own databases and found 1,722 names in the Panama Papers that match with entities that had been reported by EU Member States as having been involved in potential money-laundering transactions.European ParliamentGilinski didn’t do business with Mossack Fonseca, so the Panama Papers didn’t directly affect the Colombian banker, but  Spanish media and the Paradise Papers did.The second offshore revealed GNB Sudameris and many of Gilinski’s family had offshore accounts in more than a dozen Caribbean tax havens.Spanish media additionally revealed that Sabadell and Gilinski never told financial authorities that the Spanish bank lent the one of the Colombian investor’s Panamanian firms $275 million around the time Gilinski invested $337 in Sabadell.The ECB slapped the Spanish bank with a $2 million fine in May 2018 for failing to report the sales and acquisition of major assets between 1 January 2014 and 7 November 2016.Among these transactions was Sabadell’s acquisition of the GNB Sudameris shares from Gilinski’s now-defunct holding in the Netherlands.When Sabadell sold these shares for $60 million to a Panamanian company in March 2019, Spanish media implied Gilinski hadn’t sold 3% of his shares in the bank as reported to the Spanish central bank in 2016, but had dumped his entire 7% stake.The media façadeGilinski’s father Isaac complained in 2007 already about the bad press he was getting after the SEC sanction, the piling sanctions of Colombia’s financial superintendent and the ongoing legal battle over Bancolombia.They didn’t have the pants or the courage to go with the truth. Someday I will have media, that’s for sure. I have already made some proposals.Isaac GilinskiThe patriarch’s heir did well until his pride got the best of Gilinski and the banker found his family, his Colombian bank and his Caribbean businesses exposed by the media.Gilinski went shopping to manipulate public opinion, which had worked wonders for Colombia’s richest man, Luis Carlos Sarmiento, business tycoon Carlos Ardila Lulle and the Santo Domingo family for years.The five families who own the news in ColombiaThe banker and his son Gabriel announced they had bought weekly Semana in January 2019, which he would turn into “the Colombian Fox News” with the help of journalist “Vicky Davila,” a member of the infamous Gnecco crime family.Instead of Europe, where banking regulators were becoming stricter by the year, Gilinski decided to focus on his tax haven empire in the Caribbean and bought the more than 75% of the shares of the FirstCaribbean International Bank from  Canada’s CIBC in November that year.Using one of his firms in the British Virgin Islands, the Colombian banker additionally increased his stake in the British Metro Bank to 9% in December last year.Two months later, the bank found itself embroiled in a scandal over handling money from Cuba and Iran in breach of strict US and EU sanctions.GNB Sudameris announced in June that Colombia’s financial watchdog fined the bank for failing to implement measures against money laundering and the investigative journalism collective of the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers released a leak from the US financial crime agency FinCEN in September.The leak exposing “the role of global banks in industrial-scale money laundering — and the bloodshed and suffering that flow in its wake” and alleged GNB Sudameris Peru and Paraguay, and Gilinski’s newly acquired businesses in the Caribbean had been flagged over suspicious transactions.The increased scrutiny has cost the banker who quadrupled the value of his first bank in just three years a few hundred million dollars over the past few years, according to Forbes.Jaime Gilinski’s fortuneGilinski’s banking business is still doing considerably better than Semana, however. The magazine all but collapsed in November last year when Davila was appointed editor-in-chief of the publication.The irony of the sister-in-law of one of Colombia’s most infamous bank robbers running the magazine of one of Colombia’s shadiest banking families was too much for Semana’s journalists.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque on Monday faked results of his security policy in 2020, which saw massacres almost quadruple and violence by illegal armed groups increase.In a speech, Duque ignored the terrifying increase in massacres and the persistent mass killing of human rights defenders, community leaders and demobilized FARC guerrillas.Instead, the president implied that the lowest number in homicides in 46 year that was due to a coronavirus lockdown was the result of his widely criticized security policy.Homicides in Colombia reach historic low amid pandemicDuque also praised controversial defense minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo’s claim that the security forces have eradicated 130,000 hectares of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, ignoring this strategy is broadly considered futile.The president vowed to step up his militaristic counternarcotics policy that has yet to show any results.Duque failed to mention the implementation of peace policies as agreed by his predecessor, former President Juan Manuel Santos, with the FARC in 2016.Massacres in Colombia more than triple as corruption cripples governmentThe government’s reluctance to implement this peace deal and counterproductive drug policy is broadly considered to be fueling violence, particularly in rural areas where illegal armed groups are in control.The president, whose denial of reality has become his trademark, tried to portray his cabinet and the security forces as a success while much of the country is living in terror.Conflict monitors expect political violence and armed conflict to further escalate this year as Duque’s security policy is slowly falling apart.Additionally, crime experts fear that the economic consequences of the coronavirus are likely to increase violent crime and continue to benefit illegal armed groups and organized crime organizations.Duque vowed to step up the number of “blows” against illegal armed groups and organized crime whose relevance were generously inflated last year and present more statistics to distort reality.With the president showed the least interest in effectively improving public security, Colombia will likely see a further deterioration of security and governability.

" Colombia’s industry watchdog slapped the banking and construction corporation of the country’s richest man with a major fine, claiming its corruption violated free market principles.The fine imposed on Luis Carlos Sarmiento’s Grupo Aval on December 28 came six weeks after one of its subsidiaries, Banco de Bogota, was fined by the banking watchdog for evading money laundering regulations.‘Colombia’s largest banking corporation evaded money laundering regulations’The latest fine is because two other subsidiaries, Corficolombiana and Episol, bribed officials together with Brazilian engineering firm Odebrecht in order to be granted the construction of one of Colombia’s biggest road infrastructure projects in history, the Ruta del Sol II.In total, the Colombian and Brazilian participants in the corruption scheme were fined $95 million for the 2009 bribery of former President Alvaro Uribe’s vice-Minister of Transport, Gabriel Garcia.The bribery came to light in late 2016 when the United States Justice Department (DOJ) struck a plea deal with Odebrecht that implicated Grupo Aval, which is supposedly being investigated by the DOJ.The bribery scandal became one of the most crushing in recent history as it found former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez accursed of trying to cover up the corruption practices.Martinez knew about the bribery since 2015 already, because he was “Sarmiento’s guy” and Grupo Aval’s corporate lawyer at the time.The Ruta del Sol wasn’t the first corruption scandal implicating Grupo Aval. The Americans’ involvement, however, forced Colombian authorities to take action against the corporation of the man who has bankrolled the campaigns of all the country’s presidents for at least 20 years.Colombia puts Odebrecht bribery suspect in charge of infrastructureThe President Ivan Duque appointed Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa last year, investigations against, among others, the son of Sarmiento, appears to have been put on hold.The president owes Banco de Bogota at least $6 million dollars and could go bankrupt if Sarmiento decides to ask for his money back. bankscorruptiongrupo aval ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-largest-banking-corporation-fined-over-corrupting-free-market/,Colombia’s largest banking corporation fined for corrupting free market
" Colombia’s police said Monday they arrested an alleged money launderer whose organization allegedly was dismantled by the prosecution a month ago already.In an apparent attempt to inflate results, government-loyal newspaper El Tiempo reported that police, the prosecution and the military arrested 177 alleged members of paramilitary group AGC, a.k.a. “Clan del Golfo,” in simultaneous operation in 17 of Colombia’s 32 provinces.Among those detained was alleged money launderer John Fredy Zapata, whose arrest had been announced by the prosecution in December last year already.Colombia’s ‘music and soccer patronized by drug money’Of the 177 people who were arrested in “Operation Shield,” 155 were wanted on, among other things, homicide, drug trafficking and extortion charges.Newspaper El Espectador reported that 198 people were arrested in a series of 38 operations targeting the feared paramilitary group that is accused by the United States of being Colombia’s largest drug trafficking organization.President Ivan Duque stressed that among those arrested was mid-level AGC  commander “Aquiles,” who allegedly had traveled to the Orinoco region in the east of the country to strengthen the paramilitaries’ presence there.The majority of the arrest were made in the AGC’s stomping ground in the northwestern Antioquia and Cordoba provinces, El Espectador quoted police intelligence unit DIJIN as saying.Duque has been under pressures to come up with public policies that would allow the dismantling of the AGC and other groups that were formed by dissident members of demobilized paramilitary organization AUC.These policies would be part of a peace process with demobilized guerrilla group FARC, which is opposed by the president’s far-right party whose leaders, former President Alvaro Uribe, is accused of having had ties to this group.Instead, Duque appears to be seeking to dismantle the AGC through military and police action, which would prevent that arrested or killed members reveal their ties to politicians, the military and the private sector.

" The mayors of Colombia’s capital Bogota and Medellin ordered a lockdown and a curfew on Thursday as a surge in COVID infections is saturating hospitals.The measures to curb the spreading of the coronavirus are the toughest since April last year when the national government began a gradual reactivation of the economy.In response to a warning of the Health Ministry, Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez expanded a partial lockdown and Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero issued a total lockdown that will last until Tuesday morning.Newly registered coronavirus infectionsAccording to Lopez, the arrival of the more infectious strain of the coronavirus is rapidly saturating Bogota’s healthcare system where hospitalizations are “through the rough.”The lockdown that took force in the north of the city on Monday will be extended until the 17th and expanded in localities in the northwest starting Tuesday.This lockdown will be lifted on the 21st, according to the Mayor’s Office.Medellin’s mayor said that the coronavirus strain that originates from Britain “probably” has begun infecting people in Colombia’s second largest city too and also ordered a full lockdown and a curfew from 7PM until 5AM.Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina, who is dealing with a hospital saturation rate of 95%, did not order a full lockdown, but a curfew from 11PM until 5AM until the end of the long weekend.While the mayors and governors have begun issuing measures to curb an uncontrollable outbreak of the coronavirus, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz has been trying to coordinate a vaccination campaign.The vaccination of high priority cases like people over 80 and healthcare personnel will begin in the second week of February, Ruiz said Wednesday.The minister issued mandatory testing for people traveling from abroad earlier this week as the government is carefully rewinding relaxation measures.Both national and local authorities blame the recent surge in infections on the possible arrival of the more infectious strain of the coronavirus and holiday celebrations in December.

" Conflict experts fear that 2021 could become a grim year for Colombia, where political campaigning will begin after a terrifying surge in massacres and assassinations.Last year saw the highest number of assassinated human rights defenders and community leaders since 2011 and the persistent killing of FARC members who demobilized in 2017, according to conflict monitor Indepaz.This violence was already threatening a peace process that followed the 2016 peace deal between the FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos before the country was shocked by a wave of massacres not seen in years.The coming year could be worse as the government of President Ivan Duque persistently denies reality and 2021 will be decisive for the 2022 elections.Looking at of the prospects for 2021, I believe that little will change and the situation will become gloomier.Political analyst Fredy Alexander ChaverraThe year of the massacreAt least 375 people were murdered in 90 massacres in 2020, according to Indepaz, which 25 cases of the killing of more than three persons in 2019 and eight in 2015 when the FARC was still in arms.2020 massacre victims in ColombiaTrying to blame narcosThe government of President Ivan Duque has tried to blame the violence on drug trafficking, but stands alone, as the government has refused to take action to dismantle paramilitary groups that were long promoted by the president’s patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.Duque all but abandoned a counternarcotics policy agreed with the FARC, the United Nations and farming communities, but has been violently opposed by drug traffickers since it took force in 2017.Duque also conveniently ignored the fact that Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo is held responsible police murdering 13 people in  Bogota on September 9, the deadliest massacre of the year.Colombia’s defense minister leaves evidence of orchestrating terrorism onlineThe government’s criminal interestsMost of the massacres, however, took place in historically violent areas that appear to suffer the consequence of the president’s reluctance to implement policies to formalize land ownership, one of the main causes of armed conflict in Colombia and a legal liability for Duque’s backers.The paramilitary groups promoted by Uribe and supported by the private sector, for example, embarked on the biggest land heist since the Spanish colonization under the pretext of fighting guerrillas, which is now being investigated by the war crimes tribunal and the prosecution.In an apparent effort to conceal the ties between death squads and the president’s allies, Duque and his party have tried to sabotage the transitional justice process that has not only been trying to shed light on war crimes and the 2011 Victims Law that seeks to return stolen land to their rightful owners.The government and the ruling party had also been accused of promoting hate speech, another major cause of violence against social leaders, according to human rights organizations.Assassinated social leaders The failing security forcesThe president’s promotion of notoriously corrupt military and police commanders has additionally sunk the security forces in crisis, which allowed the surge of paramilitary groups, FARC dissident groups and the ELN guerrilla groups.Among the reportedly five victim of the latest massacre of 2020 was a reintegrating former FARC guerrilla, of which 64 were assassinated in 2020, said Indepaz in its final update of the year.Assassinated FARC membersBleak outlook for 2021Colombia’s congressional elections and presidential elections won’t be held won’t be held until 2022, but with candidates who will have to position themselves this year.Meanwhile, Colombia’s Supreme Court is still investigating Uribe for his alleged role in a 2018 conspiracy with the mafia to secure Duque’s election and could add to tensions anytime.The government’s attempt to blame the 2020 violence solely on drug traffickers may have been grossly inaccurate, but not entirely false.Cocaine exports have been booming for years and providing generous rewards to illegal armed groups that are behind much of the violence.The president’s policies to curb drug trafficking were doomed ever since Duque took office in 2018, but are further complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has severely damaged the legal economy.Furthermore, the political parties that currently support the government could turn against “Colombia’s worst ever president” in order to have a change in 2022. 2022 electionsarmed conflictpeace processpolitical violencesocial leaders ",https://colombiareports.com/2021-the-year-after-massacres-returned-colombia-red/,2021: the year after massacres returned Colombia red

Sources in the CNE told W Radio that Daza remained silent about the plot that spurred multiple investigations.Uribe, the CD’s supreme leader and Duque’s political patron, is being investigated by the Supreme Court for allegedly ordering the election fraud.Like Daza, Duque’s friend and former campaign manager, Luis Guillermo Echeverri, and the CD’s director, Nubia Stella, are also being investigated by both the prosecution and the CNE.The president is being investigated by the House of Representatives’ Accusations Committee.Whether any of these investigations will lead to anything is uncertain; the CNE is notoriously ineffective and politicized and the Accusations Committee finished no more than one investigation since it inception in 1991.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa was a member of the campaign and has been friends since Duque since university.Colombia arrests cops who discovered 2018 election fraud plot Only the Supreme Court has a reputation of being independent but relies on prosecution investigators to gather evidence.The lack of legal progress has not prevented the political damage caused by the election fraud plot to Duque, his far-right party and his patron, who is the suspect in multiple criminal investigations. 2018 electionsAlvaro UribeDemocratic Centerelection fraudIvan DuqueJose Guillermo HernandezMaria Claudia Dazanarcopolitics ",https://colombiareports.com/former-uribe-aide-remains-silent-in-colombias-2018-election-fraud-probe/,Former Uribe aide remains silent in Colombia’s 2018 election fraud probe

" The aerial spraying of marijuana in Mexico made Colombia the main supplier to the United States, whose potheads were corrupting the South American country, US lawmakers were told in 1979.The use of the lethal Paraquat chemical had created a major scandal because it was literally poisoning American consumers, yet the US government wanted to also use it to eradicate Colombian marijuana.President Julio Cesar Turbay “indicated a reluctance to engage in an immediate spraying eradication campaign because of the international controversy” the lawmakers reported to US Congress.The State Department’s long‐unnoticed involvement in Mexican marijuana eradication has grown into a potential public‐health crisis, another in a series of foreign‐policy embarrassments for the Carter Administration, and, most recently, into a domestic political controversy that has pitted the State Department and President Carter against Senator Charles Percy’s legislation to block this controversial pro1979 funding.New York TimesLater that year, the president would agree to use aerial spraying to combat illicit drugs for the first time in history.Pablo Escobar had been flying cocaine to the US for at least two years, but apparently unnoticed as both Colombian and US authorities were mainly concerned about marijuana.The Medellin narco’s heydays would begin a year after the US lawmakers’ visit when Turbay appointed a close friend of the Ochoa crime family, Alvaro Uribe, as director of the country’s civil aviation agency.How Colombia’s former president helped kick-start the Medellin Cartel“Drug consumption in the US is the problem”The American delegation noticed that the consensus in Bogota was that the root of the problem was the growing demand for drugs in the United States.Turbay referred to recent articles in the American media which described Colombia as a nation busily engaged in producing illicit drug’s for the rest of the world. He characterized this description of Colombia as being unfair because in large measure the Colombian drug activity, he said, “was encouraged and financed by Americans.”US Congress commission“Were it not for the advanced appetites of many Americans to consume illicit drugs, Colombians would not have such incentive to produce,” everybody in Bogota seemed to agree.US has no idea what counternarcotics in Colombia actually accomplishes: watchdogUS “in a ‘prohibition era’ situation”: economistsEconomic think tank ANIF was decades ahead of its time and argued that marijuana should be legalized. The US Government was “essentially in a ‘prohibition era’ situation,” ANIF president Ernesto Samper told the US lawmakers 16 year before becoming president.What is the sense of repressing, with a high social cost as we have been doing until now, a market that is permanently stimulated by a greater tolerance and a spread of demand?ANIF president Ernesto SamperLegalization would this allow tens of thousands of farmers to enter the legal economy and significantly increase tax revenue, the economic think tank had said in a report released just before the visit.Samper was also annoyed about how Colombia’s international reputation was suffering while the United States was the country with a problem.“Traffickers in the United States continue to be the commercial and financial brains of this operation of which they take 80 percent of the profits, leaving us with 20 percent of the pie and 100 percent of the bad image,” the ANIF president complained.The Americans, however, believed marijuana “clearly affected the ability of young students to concentrate in the classroom and clearly impaired a person’s ability to operate an automobile on public highways” and needed to be eradicated instead of legalized.Chairman Wolff stated that there was no significant national movement toward Federal legalization, and that he did not foresee such action in the near future. He stressed the unanswered questions concerning the potential health hazards associated with long-term marihuana abuse, the effect of consciousness-altering drugs on our young people, and his personal opposition to all forms of drug abuse.US Congress commissionThe narco history of Colombia’s security forces | Part 1: Santa MartaUS “will continue to support Colombia in its fight against drugs”“The United States is supporting, and will continue to support Colombia in its fight against drugs,” US Ambassador Diego Asencio told Samper as the two countries embarked on one of the world’s most counter-effective and destructive drug policies ever.Almost 10 years after the visit, marijuana was no longer a concern as Colombia’s cocaine exports were booming. The CIA concluded that “the prognosis for the next two years…to deliver a significant decrement to the success being enjoyed now by the cocaine industry is grim.”Exactly 40 years after the visit, Colombia produced more cocaine than ever.The country’s defense minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, on Wednesday urged to go back to 1979 and resume aerial fumigation, not with Paraquat or Agent Orange, but glyphosate. counternarcoticsDrug policydrug traffickingUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/us-counternarcotics-in-colombia-a-prehistory/,US counternarcotics in Colombia: a prehistory

" While Colombia’s government is trying to get extradited paramilitary leaders repatriated and behind bars, President Ivan Duque’s party wants them far away from the war crimes tribunal.The Democratic Center (CD) party has every reason to silence the AUC’s former commanders as they could threaten both the party, the government and key political allies if they testify before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP).The cooperation of the AUC’s former top commander, Salvatore Mancuso, and former commanders Rodrigo Tovar and Hernan Giraldo were severely complicated when former President Alvaro Uribe extradited them and 11 others.Tovar stopped collaborating with justice following the murder of of his brother in 2009 and also Mancuso claims his family has suffered harassment in an attempt to silence him.The AUC’s dirt on the “good Colombians”The former top commander has publicly claimed former President Alvaro Uribe received his support in the 2002 elections and that Colombia’s ambassador to the Washington DC, Francisco Santos, sought his support.The cousin of Senate President Arturo Char, former Congressman David Char, is cooperating with the JEP after admitting to having ties to Tovar’s Northern Bloc and extradited Medellin crime lord “Don Berna.”Uribe’s son’s allegedly did business with Giraldo, who commanded the “Tayrona Resistance Front.”Colombia’s ambassador to Washington DC and his growing terrorism support problemMancuso has additionally been one of the most outspoken about the support of government-friendly media like television network RCN and newspaper El Tiempo for the now-defunct paramilitary group.Justice Minister Wilson Ruiz told weekly Semana on Wednesday that he has urged US authorities to repatriate Mancuso in order to throw the former AUC chief in prison.The weekly said the minister is also seeking the repatriation of Giraldo.How one of Colombia’s biggest sexual predators built a network of power through rape Trying to keep the former AUC chiefs quietIndependent Senator Roy Barreras wants Mancuso and other former AUC chiefs to testify before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) in exchange for judicial benefits, but this is fiercely opposed by the CD.Under the current regulations, the JEP can only grant benefits to former paramilitary commanders if they can prove to also have been sponsors of the AUC.The party of Uribe and Duque is trying to push the debate over Congress’ three-month Christmas recess and can count on the support of the Senate President, a prominent member of the notoriously corrupt Char Clan from Barranquilla.Mancuso has been waiting to be repatriated to either Colombia or Italy, where he also has citizenship. Giraldo is expected to be released within weeks.Tovar has also tried to be granted benefits by the JEP after his repatriation in September, but this was rejected by the transitional court.The three former paramilitary commanders commanded the AUC’s main blocs along the Caribbean coast until the designated terrorist organization demobilized between 2003 and 2006.Until the AUC commanders’ extradition, their cooperation with justice had already resulted in the incarceration of dozens of Uribe’s political allies and were threatening the former president and his family, which is facing multiple accusations they colluded with death squads.Uribe is being investigated for allegedly co-founding the Bloque Metro paramilitary group in his native Antioquia province.

In Colombia, the alleged mafia boss has seen all criminal charges go up in smoke except for one homicide.Meanwhile, President Ivan Duque and his political party are in legal trouble over their ties to one of Figueroa’s late money launderers and the drug trafficking organization’s 2018 campaign support.Whether by lying of telling the truth, the alleged mafia boss from the northern La Guajira province has the power to take down the government and embarrass the DOJ.Figueroa is just one of several whose astute manipulation of politics has been beneficial for their fate in court or criminal activity.Colombia doubles down on trying to make president’s narco ties go awayAccess to all levels of government“Los Rastrojos,” a Norte del Valle Cartel spin-off, were able to consolidate control over the Venezuelan border doing a favor to Duque and Venezuela’s opposition to whom they had access through regional politicians.“La Constru,” an organized crime group from the south, allegedly found their way to Congress after cutting jailed former House Representative Jimmy Harold in on an illegal mining racket.The brother of Senator Jose Obdulio Gaviria, a cousin of late drug lord Pablo Escobar, has publicly admitted his ties to crime syndicate “Oficina de Envigado,” which is largely dedicated to money laundering in Medellin.The scandals compromising Bogota may be just the tip of the iceberg, according to electoral observers, who warned ahead of the 2019 local and regional elections that organized crime groups were targeting lower-level politicians to protect drug trafficking routes or illegal mining operations.One week after Colombia inaugurated mayors, four already in jailCorruption and infiltrationAll of the aforementioned organized crime groups have access to local law enforcement and the military through corruption or by helping the security forces fight common enemies like guerrilla group ELN.The Titan Joint Task Force has been accused of working together with the AGC, Colombia’s largest paramilitary group that is accused by US authorities of also being the country’s largest drug trafficking organization.The former commander of the Medellin-based 4th Brigade is in jail after evidence he was trafficking arms for “La Oficina.”The crime syndicate infiltrated of the National Police’s controversial “Citizens Participation Network” that allowed their assassins chief in Medellin to avoid clashes with local police by monitoring their activity.Medellin mafia boss given police radio and access to intelligence: prosecutionCheckmateThe mafias have exploited the weaknesses of Colombia’s political system and security forces to the point they have become untouchable.Political corruption has eroded public confidence to the point that many politicians can only get elected using the very corruption that destroyed popular support.Corruption in the security forces has diminished their capacity to the point that both police and the military have become reliant on the criminal forces that corrupted them in the first place.Growing public distrust of the security forces in turn allows illegal armed groups to present themselves as a reliable alternative authority to safeguard public order and further erode the authority of state institutions. corruptionnarcopoliticsorganized crimeparapolitics ",https://colombiareports.com/the-blurring-line-between-colombias-mafia-and-government/,The blurring line between Colombia’s mafia and government
" Survivors and family members of people who were murdered in the Bogota Massacre in September claim that cops allegedly behind the bloodbath in Colombia’s capital are harassing them.The family of one of the 13 people who were murdered on September 9 told Noticias Uno that police harassment is forcing them to leave Bogota’s Verbenal neighborhood.The Inspector General’s Office is trying to determine which cops carried out the massacre but is not investigating Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo and the deputy National Police chief, General Gustavo Moreno, who oversaw the state terror campaign.What’s keeping Inspector General Fernando Carrillo is a mystery.Trujillo was tweeting about his “legitimate use of state force” before, during and after the massacre.Colombia’s defense minister leaves evidence of orchestrating terrorism onlineVideo footage from the massacre shows there are no more than a dozen suspects between the cops working at the Verbenal police post and the reinforcements they called in.Of these cops, less than a handful fired registered bullets from their registered guns into a crowd.Identifying the murderers may require forensics, but no rocket science.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa has shown no interest in investigating any alleged crimes committed by the government of his university buddy, President Ivan Duque.The cops in Verbenal, where three people died and 30 were injured during the police massacre, are more abusive then ever as they apparently are allowed to get away with murder.“We’re going to have to move because we’re suffering a lot of police harassment since they killed our brother. They haven’t left us in peace the past three months, they’re on top of us,” one of the fatal victims’ sister told Noticias Uno.District ombudsman Guillermo Rivera told the news program that “this requires a swift response from the competent authorities.”So far, however, no authority has taken any action to end police terror anywhere in Bogota.To the contrary, the increasingly authoritarian President Ivan Duque and his defense minister can’t seem to stop praising Colombia’s security forces despite the terrorism and corruption claims.

" Mayors and governors throughout Colombia are concerned over a possible second surge in COVID-19 infections during the holiday season.Contrary to the United States and Europe, Colombia has been spared a second surge of the coronavirus after a peak in September.The country’s aviation authorities have been struggling to resume international air travel, which has allowed health authorities keeping the pandemic under control with relatively mild measures.Both national and local authorities have expressed concern about the holidays, however, as Christmas celebrations traditionally consist of a month of social activities that could trigger outbreaks.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz urged caution on Monday during his appearance on President Ivan Duque’s daily propaganda broadcast.The way we behave during the Christmas and New Year’s Eve festivities will be decisive in maintaining the economic revival of all sectors.Health Minister Fernando RuizBogota Mayor Claudia Lopez expressed concern about the increase in infections and deaths registered in the capital in the first two weeks of December.Lopez echoed Ruiz’s calls for caution and invited resident of Bogota to go into a two-week quarantine if they want to visit their family members on Christmas Eve or New Year’s Eve.Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero was considerably more concerned about the situation in his city and warned he may have to issue a curfew on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve if rising infections threaten to collapse the healthcare system of Colombia’s second largest city.Governor Anibal Gaviria said that a curfew between midnight and 6AM would be in place in half of Antioquia, including Medellin, until the 20th to prevent an outbreak.All major cities canceled mass events like concerts that historically are part of the festivities.National and most local authorities are hesitant to impose a new lockdown that would be difficult to impose after the arrival of the virus in March was followed by severe restrictions on movement that lasted for months.Only in Cucuta, a city on the border with Venezuela, the mayor announced a curfew for an indefinite period of time after a sudden surge in hospitalizations threaten to collapse the municipal healthcare system.Also in the nearby city of Bucaramanga a curfew is in place in an attempt to prevent a saturation of hospitals. coronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-urges-caution-to-prevent-covid-surge-during-holidays/,Colombia urges caution to prevent COVID surge during holidays
" A US Embassy official was actively involved in a DEA conspiracy to discredit Colombia’s war crimes tribunal last year, evidence released by Noticias Uno showed.In a letter, Special agent Craig M. Michelin of the DEA’s Country Office asked his liaison at Colombia’s Prosecutor General’s Office in February last year to provide $500,000 for an illegal operation against the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP).Local media previously implicated Michelin in a conspiracy that led to the arrest of former FARC ideologue “Jesus Santrich” that sunk Colombia’s peace process in crisis in April 2018.The criminal conspiracy to extradite Santrich began failing in October after which a DEA agent flew in for a second conspiracy to entrap the JEP’s chief prosecutor, Giovanni Alvarez, and magistrate Ivan Gonzalez.DEA bungled conspiracy against Colombia’s war crimes tribunal: reportAfter this conspiracy also failed, Michelin wrote prosecutor Mauricio Nieto on February 25 last year that “a criminal organization” agreed to meet “in order to sell, delay or omit decisions that are part of criminal and administrative drug trafficking processes… in exchange for a sum of approximately $500 thousand dollars.”Former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez personally granted the money on February 27, days before an assistant prosecutor, Julian Carlos Bermeo, was filed receiving $40,000 while in the company of a convicted criminal, former Senator Luis Alberto Gil.An associate of Gil, Orlando Villamizar, simultaneously received $460,000 in a different location in Bogota.According to the prosecution, Bermeo agreed to delay the JEP’s testing of evidence against Santrich, a claim denied by the suspect and dismissed by Alvarez, who told press that Bermeo had no way to influence the proceedings.Martinez resigned in May last year after the JEP ordered an investigation against the former chief prosecutor and DEA agents who had been conspiring against Santrich and the FARC’s former political chief, “Ivan Marquez,” since before June 2017.How Colombia’s top corporate lawyer became a ‘threat to national security’Recordings made public by newspaper El Espectador last month revealed that the prosecution had been conspiring to frame both FARC members and pro-peace politicians since February 2017, but without success.The US government’s alleged meddling in internal affairs strained relations between the US government and Colombia’s judicial and legislative branches, and spurred Santrich and Marquez to rearm.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque said Wednesday that he will ask an allegedly criminal former chief prosecutor facing treason charges to join “some commissions” on fighting crime.In an interview with news program CM&, the far-right president said he would not appoint former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez as ambassador in Spain as previously rumored.Martinez allegedly took part in multiple criminal conspiracies with DEA agents that all but destroyed Colombia’s peace process, ordered corporate spying and obstructed the investigation into the Odebrecht bribery scandal.Nevertheless, Duque said he considered the alleged criminal “a person who is committed to fighting crime” and will ask Martinez to take part in commissions “to strengthen crime fighting.”We will invite him to participate in some of the analytical commissions that we are going to form on specific topics to strengthen the fight against organized crime.President Ivan DuqueThe former chief prosecutor never studies criminal law and is accused of an impressive list of crimes, but this is no objection for the president, who is embroiled in an impressive number of corruption scandals himself.Opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda (Democratic Pole), one of the government’s most outspoken critics, celebrated Duque’s decision not to let Martinez represent the country in Spain, but deplored the decision to put an alleged criminal on the government payroll to fight crime.Martinez has been accused in public debates and in Congress of all kinds of actions that should be investigated by an independent body. Unfortunately, they are in the hands of the House investigations committee, where these investigations will not be able to move forward. Martinez should be removed from public office and brought to justice.Senator Ivan CepedaThe president, who was elected with the help of the mafia and questionable regional “clans,” has consistently appointed questionable characters loyal to his far-right Democratic Center party in government position.Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, is a former Medellin Cartel associate who resigned from the Senate earlier this year to evade Supreme Court investigations into his alleged complicity in two massacres, a homicide, fraud and bribery.The Supreme Court is still investigating Uribe’s alleged involvement in election fraud in collusion with a drug trafficking organization.

" Colombia’s finance minister proposed to temporarily allow employers to hire workers for 80% of the country’s $250 monthly minimum wage, claiming this would boost economic recovery.Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla made the proposal after brainstorming with economists and business associations about how to help the economy recover from to the coronavirus, which has skyrocketed both poverty and unemployment in Colombia.Colombia’s unemployment rateIn an interview with Blu Radio, the minister said he and former finance ministers believed that the measure, which would allow employers to formally pay newly hired workers for a period of a few weeks, would stimulate employers to hire new personnel.Former Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes, who supports the proposal, said it could create a million jobs for the estimated 2 million people who were out a job in October, according to statistics agency Dane.Neither Carrasquilla nor Hommes specified how long employers would allow to maintain wages below minimum and how to prevent mass layoffs among those who are currently employed.The finance minister is notoriously weak with numbers and found little support for his proposal outside his inner circle..Economist Ivan Jaramillo of Bogota’s Rosario University said Carrasquilla’s idea as “evidently unconstitutional” and would contribute nothing to economic recovery, according to .Minimum wage in Colombia ought to guarantee a “minimum vital income” by law, the economist said while 22.4% of workers in October already said that they did not earn enough to make a living, according to statistics agency DANE.Additionally, “paying less than the minimum wage would not allow an economic recovery because people would not have the capacity to consume and there would be downward competition,” according to Jaramillo.Carrasquilla did not address poverty while the rate for this has skyrocketed to between 47% and 49%, according to economic think tank Fedesarollo.President Ivan Duque introduced a monthly stipend of $45 for some 3 million people almost immediately after the crisis hit Colombia, but according to Fedesarollo some 7 million people are estimated to be starving.According to Natalia Galvis of the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the countryside is being starved into urbanization as “only 28% of the Solidary Income aid are being delivered to these home,” the economist told Dinero.Economists and the opposition have been pushing a $100 minimum basic income, but this proposal is opposed by the government and was sunk in the House of Representatives last week.Labor unions and the powerful business associations will be negotiating next year’s minimum wage, but these talks haven’t resulted in an agreement in recent memory, leaving this decision with the labor minister.

" The coronavirus may have deprived tens of thousands of victims of domestic and sexual violence of support in Colombia despite increased government efforts.The arrival of the coronavirus in March and subsequent lockdown measures meant to curb contagion were accompanied by a steep drop in reports of domestic violence, according to statistics by the Medical Examiner’s Office.The government embarked on a major campaign to facilitate the reporting of domestic and sexual violence after Vice-Prosecutor General Martha Janeth warned of a surge in femicides in early April, but apparently without effect.Pandemic silences victims of domestic and sexual violenceWhile reported homicides and suicides remained relatively unchanged, reports of domestic violence and rape dropped steeply, according to the Medical Examiner’s monthly statistics.Reported violenceThe gradual reactivation of social life was also accompanied by a gradual increase in reports of domestic violence and rape, but continued to be lower than last year as underreporting presumably persists.Statistics contradict women’s rights activistsWomen’s rights organization Mujer Despierta (Wake Up Woman) received 500% more calls for assistance during this period, according to the organization’s spokeswoman Lorena Garcia. “It’s incredible,” the activist told public radio network Radio Nacional in late November.There have been situations not only of violence, but also suicide attempts and depressions, apart from the disease, which has accelerated the issue of family violence, and requests for assistance rose by 500%.Mujer Despierta spokeswoman Lorena GarciaIn the southwestern Valle del Cauca province, femicides went up 41% from 22 between January and October until 31 in the same period this year, the district prosecution told Cali newspaper El Pais.According to the United Nations, this obeyed to a trend throughout Latin America where the international organization registered a 31.5% increase in femicides.The help line for domestic violence promoted by the government also saw a 99% increase in calls, according to Radio Nacional, but these reports apparently didn’t result in medical exams with the exception of fatal violence.The government’s increased efforts to reach victims of domestic violence and sexual violence during the pandemic have apparently left tens of thousands of abuse women and children without help.More than six women and girls every hour suffered domestic abuse last year.

" The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reportedly bungled a conspiracy against Colombia’s war crimes tribunal in an attempt to cover up a botched conspiracy against demobilized guerrillas.A DEA agent and a Colombian accomplice tried to entrap the chief prosecutor and a magistrate of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) in order to accuse them of bribery in late 2018, according to evidence obtained by Noticias Uno.The news program made chats of the alleged counternarcotics cop public in which the DEA official plotted a botched conspiracy to entrap the JEP’s top prosecutor, Giovanni Alvarez, and magistrate Ivan Gonzalez.The failed operation cost the head of Colombia’s chief prosecutor, triggered a surge in illegal armed groups formed by former FARC guerrillas and strained relations between the two countries.JEP chief prosecutor Giovanni Alvarez and magistrate Ivan GonzalezA conspiracy to cover up a conspiracyFake Sinaloa Cartel attorney “Gerardo Assab” appeared in Colombia in October 2018, according to Noticias Uno.Assab looks a lot like Marco Aurelio Garcia, one of the DEA agents who was reportedly involved in the failed conspiracy to fabricate drug trafficking charges against former FARC leaders “Ivan Marquez” and “Jesus Santrich.”This conspiracy was shoddy from the beginning, but going really wrong because Colombia’s prosecution released evidence indicating a charge against former FARC leader “Jesus Santrich” was a hoax.Did a DEA hoax devastate Colombia’s peace process?Alleged serial bungler “Gerardo Assab”In an apparent attempt to cover up the failed conspiracy against the former FARC leader, the alleged DEA agent tried to neutralize the JEP by trying another conspiracy, this time with bribes, Assab told a Colombian associate.The alleged counternarcotics cop had a $6 million budget to convince the top JEP officials for “proceedings to delay the holiday of our friend,” Assab told his associate on December 4, 2018.The alleged DEA agent stressed that “no resources will be released without a meeting” that would provide the evidence to take down the JEP’s judicial officials.The plan was simple: if only a judge would fall in the trap not even a virtually blind former guerrilla chief would fall in, nobody would think the average DEA agent is an imbecile.The plan failed and to add insult to injury, local media revealed evidence that then-US ambassador Kevin Whitaker was lying that the Department of Justice never received a request for evidence.US did receive request for evidence in FARC leader extradition case: reportStupid enough for the DEACarlos Julio BermeoAssab and Colombia’s prosecution had to settle for less, so they bribed an assistant prosecutor who got a job at the JEP two days after the prosecution’s October 2018 blunder instead.Prosecution cameras recorded an alleged DEA agent giving assistant prosecutor Carlos Julio Bermeo $40,000 in March 2019.Bermeo had absolutely nothing to do with the Santrich case, but at least fell in the DEA trap.The prosecution claimed Bermeo agreed to delay the former guerrilla leader’s extradition, which the assistant prosecutor denies and the prosecution has yet to prove.“There is even talk of a magistrate,” the prosecutor told the court, indicating he knew about the failed conspiracy to bribe Gonzalez.The money was for “the return of documents sent by a foreign intelligence agency” the US government has yet to send, according to the JEP and Colombia’s Supreme Court.Colombia ‘begs’ US for cooperation in case against missing FARC leaderWashington and Bogota degenerateKevin Whitaker (Screenshot YouTube)Alvarez immediately smelled a rat and ordered to investigate the JEP’s entire prosecution unit while US authorities were becoming increasingly desperate.By April, congressmen accused Whitaker of trying to extort them into limiting the JEP’s powers and court officials began avoiding the ambassador like the plague.The DEA’s disaster was complete in May last year when the JEP ordered to investigate the feds and Colombia’s chief prosecutor, Nestor Humberto Martinez, instead.Martinez resigned immediately and Santrich disappeared weeks after his release as FARC guerrillas throughout Colombia began to rearm.Whitaker was replaced almost immediately, leaving the his successor, US Ambassador Philip Goldberg, to take the biggest punch that came last month.El Espectador released evidence of the the DEA and Colombia’s prosecution had been conspiring to sink Colombia’s peace process since February 2017, triggering treason charges against Martinez.The former chief prosecutor’s future became even bleaker after the publication of evidence he conspired with the DEA in an attack on Colombia’s justice system.

" Indigenous leaders from southwest Colombia received a death threat within hours of a massacre in which at least four people were murdered on Saturday.The death threat signed by a dissident FARC group was sent to the Indigenous Elders from Northern Cauca (ACIN) after armed men on Saturday evening indiscriminately opened fire at people in several places in the war-torn region.According to Senator Feliciano Valencia, a native Colombian from the north of Cauca, the attacks on members of local indigenous communities took place in the municipalities of Santander de Quilichao and Caloto.In the death threat, the “Dagoberto Ramos Front,” one of the most brutal and powerful illegal armed groups in the region, threatened to kill more than a dozen other native leaders, including the senator, for impeding the FARC dissidents’drug trafficking activities.“The situation in Cauca is getting worse,” said Valencia after conflict monitoring NGO Indepaz reported that 13 massacres have been committed in the southwestern province so far this year.The indigenous have found themselves increasingly under fire from rearmed former FARC guerrillas who want to use their indigenous reserve to cultivate coca, the basic ingredient for cocaine, and marihuana.Several of the reserves, that enjoy high levels of autonomy, are additionally strategically located near fluvial drug trafficking routes to the Pacific Ocean.The indigenous are trying to prevent this by increasing their own security with the use of their unarmed Indigenous Guard.Despite multiple pleas from the native Colombians, the government of President Ivan Duque is reluctant to implement a peace deal with the FARC.At the same time, however, the security forces seem unable to respond to the drug-fueled violence that has hit Cauca and the northwestern Antioquia province hard.In both provinces the security forces have been accused of colluding with drug trafficking groups.Both provinces have a history of violence due to chronic state neglect, and the presence of illegal economies like drug trafficking and illegal mining.The defense ministry did not immediately respond latest attacks that indigenous organizations are part of a genocide. armed conflictCaucadrug traffickingFARC dissidentsindigenous issues ",https://colombiareports.com/southwest-colombia-indigenous-leaders-threatened-after-4-dead-in-killing-spree/,Southwest Colombia indigenous leaders threatened after 4 dead in killing spree

His almost 20-year-old strategy to seek the middle is working, and could be working even better without the former Medellin mayor.Duque and his “Uribistas” have lost such significant support over the past three years that the president’s Democratic Center party is heading towards becoming a fringe minority.Petro’s approval rating did go up, but the progressive can still count on significant disapproval, not just from “the right,” but from all over the political spectrum.The spill-over of the “Uribista” implosion is primarily benefiting the politicians around Fajardo who are promoting moderation and pragmatism.This strategy could make Colombia’s moderates, who make up the country’s largest electoral constituency, the decisive factor in the elections instead of prey for “the left” and “the right.”Disapproval of Colombia’s left and rightSource: GallupEnding a duopolistic political historyThe introduction of a decisive third force would be almost revolutionary. Colombia’s political system has historically been a duopoly similar to the United States, only more violent.Colombia’s traditional powerhouses, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, have gone to war over this binary division and the social-democratic Patriotic Union was literally exterminated after it sought to take part in elections after 1985.The 1991 constitution allowed the peaceful participation of other political parties, but candidates in presidential elections more often than not sought victory by dividing the electoral base in the middle rather than empowering it.The first to break with this divisive strategy was former President Juan Manuel Santos in 2014 after successfully seeking the support of both conservatives and progressives for a peace process with now-demobilized FARC guerrillas.Fajardo could go into history as the politician who ended binary politics by making a moderate force the decisive factor in politics. 2022 electionsComptroller General's OfficeGreen Alliancesergio fajardo ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-2022-elections-could-end-the-left-and-right-debate/,How 2022 elections could end Colombia’s ‘left right’ dilemma once and for all
" Colombia’s Congress is debating an electoral reform that would allow government meddling with elections and throw the door wide open for fraud.The reform bill as it stands would allow the president and his hand-picked National Registrar to organize the elections as they please.The bill additionally seeks to do away with the so-called Guarantee Law, which disallows state entities to sign contracts with private contractors before and after elections to prevent bribery.Brazen attack on free and fair electionsWhile the controversial reform is not supposed to take force until 2024 — two years after far-right President Ivan Duque is expected to leave office — the bill is arguably the administration’s most brazen attack on democracy to date.The reform would give the president and the National Registrar all kinds of discretionary powers to organize elections, replace personnel at will and meddle with mechanisms in place to prevent and detect fraud.The electoral reform additionally seeks to grant the president the power to replace magistrates of the already notoriously inefficient National Electoral Council (CNE).Mechanisms for fraudRegistrar Alexander VegaFurthermore, without Guarantee Law, authorities of any kind would be able to use public funds to, for example, buy votes or otherwise meddle with the elections.The bill is sponsored by Interior Minister Alicia Arango and National Registrar Alexander Vega, both close allies of the president and his allegedly criminal patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.The president of the CNE, Hernan Penagos of the U Party, also signed off on the bill that has already passed its first two votes in Congress, according to political news website La Silla Vacia.Even German Vargas concernedGerman Vargas (Image: Twitter)Even former Vice-President German Vargas, whose notoriously corrupt Radical Change party is a coalition partner of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party, rang the alarm.Last but not least, the 2021 budget increased the budget for the National Registry with 43% to freely allocate budgets, which in the worst case would make it the government’s clientelism office where companies could be paid to campaign, buy votes or engage in other practices currently considered blatantly corrupt.Duque, Uribe and multiple members of their party are supposedly under investigation for colluding with a drug trafficking organization to buy votes in the Caribbean region. election fraudelectoral reformlegislative reform ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-seeking-presidential-powers-to-meddle-with-elections/,Colombia seeking presidential powers to meddle with elections
" The killing of former guerrillas taking part in Colombia’s peace process appears largely due to government failures to provide security, according to a recent study.The study of the Rosario University from Bogota showed that, similar to the mass killings of social leaders, the murder of 238 FARC members took place in regions where where the former guerrilla group used to be in control.Because the prosecution has convicted less than 40 people in relation to these murders, there exists no reliable data on the perpetrators of the killings that spurred protests by the former guerrillas last month.The location of the murders do indicate patters of the violence that is targeting FARC members and threatening peace in Colombia in general.Sitting ducks in reintegration sites?The researchers found no correlation between between general homicide rates and the killing of FARC members, indicating that murdered former guerrillas were the victims of targeted assassinations.What stood out most is that FARC members are facing extraordinary violence in the areas around the compounds where guerrillas are taking part in reintegration programs.The security forces are supposedly providing security around the two dozen so-called ETCR’s and NAR’s, but the data indicates the military and the police are doing the opposite.Even though less than a quarter of demobilized FARC members moved into these compounds, 165 of the 238 homicides took place in the areas where FARC members are supposed to be reintegrating.FARC invades Colombia’s cities!!!

" Colombia’s military played down proven ties with now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC in a report sent to the Truth Commission, according to newspaper El Espectador.In a report, the military acknowledged it supported “civic-military” paramilitary groups when they were legal in the 1960’s, but denied responsibility for the surge of drug-fueled paramilitary violence after the 1980’s.The report is one of three in which the military tells the commission that is trying the reconstruct was happened during the armed conflict its side of the story about the rise of the AUC.The military confirmed it supported paramilitary groups after this was sanctioned in 1965, but distanced itself from groups that formed after a 1989 ban on the armament of civilians, reported El Espectador.How a US military doctrine became Colombia’s ‘origin of evil’ | Part 2: Special warfareThe two generationsThe paramilitary groups formed in the 1960’s “emerged in reaction to the risks of change in political and local regimes that came with negotiations with the guerrillas,” the military reportedly said.These “self-defense” groups were “different from the groups that acted in the Magdalena Medio region in the beginning of the 1980s, which had other interests, like being at the service of drug trafficking” according to the military.Many of these groups formed after a 1989 ban on the armament of civilians and joined the AUC in 1997, which was declared a foreign terrorist organization by the US government in 2001.Ramon Isaza, the warlord who made peace with FARC 43 years after taking up armsA convenient truthIn its report, the military acknowledged that the army took part in paramilitary massacres that occurred after legislation that “criminalized the groups of the AUC,” but denied systematic support.Instead, the military report focused on the rise of the paramilitary groups at the height of the Cold War in the 1960’s following legislation that “allowed citizens to defend their property against attacks of guerrilla organizations.”The military omitted to provide information on infamous military operations carried out with the AUC, like the 1997 “Operation Genesis” that marked the beginning of the AUC’s territorial expansion that received logistical support of the National Army.Post-war psy-ops in Colombia: How army seeks to bend the truth over armed conflictArmy attempt to bend truth “normal”The president of the Truth Commission, father Francisco de Roux, said last year he considered that the military instruction to present a convenient truth was “normal.”The FARC, the former guerrilla group also taking part in the peace process, has also consistently referred to kidnapping as “economic retentions.’We think it is normal for the institutions to have institutional points of view, it even seems important to us that they have a reasonable explanation of the way they acted and their own point of view.Truth Commission president Francisco de RouxUltimately, it will be up to the Truth Commission to present a reconstruction of the truth based on the contributions of not just the military, but also former FARC and AUC members, and victim organizations. armed conflictmilitarypeace processtruth commission ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-military-denies-systematic-support-to-paramilitaries/,Colombia’s military denies systematic support to paramilitaries

" President Ivan Duque accused the opposition of defending FARC dissidents on Saturday for proving the prosecution conspired with the US government to sabotage Colombia’s peace process.Opposition Senator Gustavo Petro on Thursday provided unequivocal evidence that former chief prosecutor Nestor Humberto Martinez conspired with the DEA to arrest former guerrilla ideologue “Jesus Santrich” on a bogus drug trafficking charge.Opposition Senators Ivan Cepeda and Antonio Sanguino subsequently announced treason charges against Martinez for almost destroying the peace process while serving foreign political interests.The war crimes tribunal had already ordered an investigation against the former chief prosecutor and the DEA agents allegedly involved in the illegal operation.Duque insisted the former guerrilla ideologue was a “mafioso” and a “narco-terrorist,” and falsely accused the opposition of portraying the former FARC leader as “a harmless dove.”The US embassy has yet to comment to the latest evidence its counternarcotics agents spent months trying to frame Santrich and “Ivan Marquez” instead of combating drug trafficking.Both former FARC leaders abandoned the peace process after both the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) and the Supreme Court ordered the release of Santrich.Marquez and Santrich and some 15 other former FARC commanders went underground and announced their rearmament in August last year.While Duque announced to continue fruitless military operations against the dissidents’ “Nueva Marquetalia” group, Santrich published a video in which he thanked the opposition senators for their “support,” which was fiercely rejected by Petro and other opposition leaders.“If Santrich wants to thank me… let him lay down his weapons,” Petro said on Twitter.Senator Roy Barreras, who also fiercely criticized the former chief prosecutor, told the FARC dissident: “Make no mistakes, Santrich. I’m not defending you, but the peace deal.”Santrich and Marquez have been stripped of all judicial benefits that came with the peace deal. In the case of Marquez, for example, this means he will have to spend at least 50 years in prison for mass murder. armed conflictFARCFARC dissidentsIvan Duquejesus santrichpeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/duque-claims-colombias-opposition-defending-farc-dissidents/,Duque claims Colombia’s opposition defending FARC dissidents
" Colombia’s migration policy sought to “whiten society” through immigration for more than half of the country’s history.The South American country’s history of migration policies is no more embarrassing than those of the United States, where children were put in cages until recently, or Europe and its history of antisemitism.Colombia’s first law after its independence from Spain, Law 1 of 1821, banned the import of slaves, which ended the immigration of Africans only years after the Spanish stopped coming.The first immigration law passed Congress in 1823 and allowed private firms to attract Europeans who would strengthen the revolutionaries’ “good nature” and “subordinate and labor-loving habits” and would strengthen the white “community of origin, religion and language; an analogy of character.”Unlike the Spanish conquistadors, who would often retire in Spain, the new immigrants were expected to have “above all, the spirit of staying among us.”Asians, however, were excluded from the government’s plans to expand the population as “there is no advantage in increasing our population with the Asian or Malay race, unlike the vigorous and intelligent European race.”White supremacy in Colombia | Part 1: Kill the Indians!Abolition created labor shortageThe abolishment of slavery in 1851, however, spurred the need for cheap labor.The Constitution of 1863 had the motto, one Nation, one Race, one God, but was largely composed by liberals who dropped the ban on Asians and even allowed them to obtain citizenship.in 1871, a Liberal Party-dominated Congress passed a law “About The Protection of Foreign Immigrants” in the hope to attract working class European migrants, which seemed to be boosting the American economy at the time.The growing working class population of slave descendants and poor European immigrants where severely threatening the political power of the Conservative Party.The xenophobe constitutionAfter President Rafael Nuñez took office in 1880, the conservative president began promoting the idea that immigration was a threat to society.Immigration is a natural phenomenon, desired by God, but one that also contains foreign immigration that among new peoples, like the Americans, pose a great danger that compromises national unity.Minister Jose María Samper (1884)The conservatives reverted many of the secular elements of the constitution what they wrote a new one in 1886, which limited the right of immigrants to obtain citizenship.One year later, the conservatives again banned the “import of Chinese for any work in the Colombian territory.”In 1888, immigrants received a second-class citizen status, making them either “temporary” or “domiciled” immigrants.Watch out for the idiotsAt the beginning of the 20th century, the conservatives had well established their so-called “Conservative Hegemony” that would keep them in power until 1930.To make sure they would stay in power, also “idiots” who could potentially have liberal preferences were banned.Under no circumstances will individuals be hired as immigrants in Colombia, nor admitted if they concur in the following circumstances: Being crazy, idiots, imbeciles, blind or deaf-mutes, vagrants, unable to work due to illness or bad physical condition, or being over sixty years old.Decree 496 of 1909The conservatives’ xenophobia was almost endless. By 1920, the decree banning “idiots” and “vagrants” was turned into Law 48 of 1920, which amplified the list of personas-non-grata.Entry to the Republic is not allowed for foreigners… those with diseases such as dementia, mania, general paralysis, chronic alcoholics,  epileptics, idiots, cretins and those who are injured and unable to work, professional beggars, bums, anarchists, those convicted of political crimes and crimes against morality.Law 48 of 1920It wasn’t until 2016 that the Constitutional Court dumped the law, claiming it was discriminatory.At the time, microbiology was being discovered and sometimes given genetic qualities, making Colombia’s scientific elite concerned about germs’ “contribution to the degeneration of the Colombian race and the role of science in the fight against this scourge that was standing in the way of the country’s development ”Gearing up racismCongress went full-blown racist in 1922 when it sought to “improve ethnic conditions, both physically and morally.” By then, the Conservative Party was trying to “whiten society.”Immigration agents will not put a visa in any passport of immigrants who are specified in Law 48 of 1920, nor of individuals who by ethnic conditions are reason for precautions in Colombia. It is forbidden the entrance to the country of elements that due to their ethnic, organic or social conditions are inconvenient for the nationality and for the best development of the race. Law 114 of 1922Colombia’s governments were fascinated by “Eugenics,” a pseudo science that was fueling segregation throughout Europe and the Americas.In 1926, immigrants would be distributed throughout the country based on the color of their skin under the presumption that white people were more productive in the highlands, leaving the coastal regions for Colombia’s black minority.By 1927, a new immigration law was filed that allowed the expulsion of anyone considered an anarchist or “violate the neutrality” of opinion that was expected of foreigners.Liberals take racism to a whole new levelThe Liberal Party ended the Conservative Hegemony in 1930 and stepped up racial discrimination on the border.In 1935, the government of President Alfonso Lopez began using quota on immigration from certain countries from eastern Europe and the middle East.The next year, “Bulgarians, Chinese, Egyptians, Estonians, Greeks, Hindus, Latvians, Latvians, Lebanese, Lithuanians, Moroccans, Palestinians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Syrians, Turks and Yugoslavs” were only allowed in the country if they had a certificate of good behavior.“Germans, Argentines, Armenians, Australians, Austrians, Belgians, Bolivians, Brazilians, Canadians, Costa Ricans, Cubans, Czechoslovakians, Chileans, Danish Dominicans, Ecuadorians, Spanish, Americans, Finns, French, Guatemalans, Haitians, Dutch, Hondurans, Hungarians, English, Irish, Italians, Japanese, Luxembourgers, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Norwegians, Panamanians, Paraguayans, Persians, Peruvians, Puerto Ricans, Portuguese, Salvadorans, Swedes, Swiss, Uruguayans and Venezuelans” additionally needed the Colombian consul in their country to vouch for them.“Gypsies, whatever their nationality, will not be allowed to enter the country” at all, according to Decree 1194 of 1936.Violence deters immigrationThe Second World War and the extremely violent period of “La Violencia” between 1948 and 1958 severely disrupted immigration to Colombia unlike in other parts of Latin America.The oil boom in Venezuela drew much migrants from across the world while Colombia stayed behind.The 1991 constitution did away with many of the country’s discriminatory laws, but it wasn’t until the 21st century that Colombia could speak of some immigration, initially from Venezuelan oil barons who were migrating to Colombia while war victims were being displaced to the neighboring country.It wasn’t until former President Alvaro Uribe began promoting improved security and relaxed migration laws to lure foreign investors that Americans and Europeans began immigrating.But still, according to the 2005 census, immigrant made up only 0.26% of the country’s population, compared to approximately 13% in the United States.The first real wave of immigration didn’t start until 2015 after a collapse in oil prices dramatically increased the influx of Venezuelans. migrationracism ",https://colombiareports.com/white-supremacy-in-colombia-part-2-migratory-racism/,White supremacy in Colombia | Part 2: migratory racism
" Colombia’s banks have been laying the perfect infrastructure for tax evasion, which is estimated to cost the State more than corruption.When even the Finance Minister appeared it the Panama Papers, it may be safe to assume that tax evasion is common practice among the country’s elite.How bad the tax evasion isAccording to the tax office DIAN, increased cooperation with the US government and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, tax inspectors may be able to identify 300,000 bank accounts through which $20 billion is being funneled to tax havens this year.This is almost double than what the DIAN was able to recover in 2017 and 50% of the tax agency’s estimated revenue this year.

" The coalition of Colombia’s President Ivan Duque lost another seat in the Senate after the arrest of a senator on bribery charges.Senator Eduardo Pulgar of the center-right U Party was arrested on Bogota’s El Dorado airport after the Supreme Court warranted his arrest.The senator is being investigated by the top court for allegedly trying to bribe a judge in his native province Antioquia who was investigating the Pulgar’s 2018 election campaign sponsors.With the arrest of Pulgar, Duque’s coalition of center-right, conservative and far-right parties lost another vote in the Senate.Colombia’s shrinking congressThe 2018 arrest of fugitive Senator-elect Aida Merlano of the Conservative Party stripped the government coalition of its first vote in the senate as parties are not allowed to replace jailed allegedly criminal lawmakers.Duque’s coalition lost a vote in the House of Representatives last year with the arrest of Representative Jimmy Harold, also of the Conservative Party. This lawmaker is being investigated for allegedly conspiring with illegal miners in his native Putumayor province.Opposition party FARC, which was formed by demobilized guerrillas in 2017, lost seats in both chambers after their political chiefs, “Ivan Marquez” and “Ivan Santrich,” abandoned an ongoing peace process.Duque’s majority not under threatWhile not threatening Duque’s majority, the arrest of Pulgar further diminishes the power of the U Party, which expelled senator Roy Barreras and Armando Benedetti last month after they declared to be in opposition of the government.The U Party, former by former President Juan Manuel Santos and former Finance Minister Oscar Ivan Zuluaga in 2014, plays a major role in the partisan balance of power in Congress.The party has been marred by corruption, however, which has deteriorated Colombians’ confidence in Congress over the years.What lawmakers like to call the “Temple of Democracy” is considered the country’s most corrupt institution by voters, according to pollster Gallup. corruptionEduardo Pulgarlegislative orderU Party ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-arrests-coalition-senator-on-bribery-charges/,Colombia arrests coalition senator on bribery charges

" Colombia’s far-right government is blaming a 2016 peace deal for its own failures to comply, the country’s largest peace movement wrote the UN Security Council.In an open letter, “Defendamos la Paz” pointed out to the UN ambassadors that Duque has presided only three meetings of the so-called National Commission for Security Guarantees since he took office in 2018.The far-right president is obliged to preside this commission once every month to develop policies that would allow the dismantling of paramilitary structures between politicians, businessmen and illegal armed groups.Is Duque’s conflict of interest promoting political violence in Colombia?Defendamos la Paz stressed how the security situation in former FARC-controlled regions continues to be critical, partly because of the government’s failure to comply, which is monitored by the Security Council.The latest report of the United Nations Verification Mission, presented to the Security Council in September 2020, says: “since the signing of the Final Agreement, the Mission has verified 297 attacks against former members of the FARC-EP, including 224 murders (including 4 of women), 20 disappearances and 53 attempted murders (including 4 for women)”. From October to November, the FARC-EP reported 18 murders additional. So far in 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia received information on 110 cases of murders of human rights defenders, of which he confirmed 51, with the others in verification process. As of October 31, of 61 massacres reported this year, 51 were documented with 195 deaths.Defendamos la PazDefendamos la Paz stressed that much of the violence is taking place where the National Army has deployed most troops.Ironically, the government blames the consequences of its own failures on the peace deal, which is fiercely opposed by Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party, according to the peace organization that consists of top politicians and dozens of social organizations.Not only has the government failed to take the measures in the Agreement to prevent and punish violence in the territories, it is also using it to deepen its smear campaign against the peace process, insisting that the responsibility lies with the Agreement.Defendamos la PazMeanwhile, “the onslaught of the government and its party against transitional justice system, that is, against the Peace Agreement, does not stop,” according to Defendamos la Paz.The peace organization urged the Security Council to take action to prevent a similar political genocide as Colombia suffered in the 1980’s and 1990’s when the security forces and paramilitaries all but exterminated the leftist Patriotic Union party.Colombia’s war crimes tribunal opens case on extermination of leftist party“We respectfully ask you to demand from the Government of Colombia a greater commitment to the Peace Agreement, to its implementation, to the signatories and to the new generations,” said Defendamos la Paz.The peace deal between the FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos was signed On November 24, 2016, but has been barely implemented by Duque. armed conflictpeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-using-government-failures-to-discredit-peace-deal/,‘Colombia blaming peace deal for government failures’

" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal on Wednesday grilled top government officials over their failure to prevent or even investigate the mass killing of demobilized FARC guerrillas.The government official were summoned to appear before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) to respond for the authorities’ chronic failures to protect demobilized FARC members.The interrogation of the officials exposed the chaos in the government of President Ivan Duque and the prosecution, which Duque’s best friend, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa.Since the signing of the Peace Accords, until November 15, 2020, 249 ex-combatants of the FARC-EP have died.JEP Prosecutor Giovanni AlvarezKilling FARC members government policy or neglect?JEP prosecutor Giovanni AlvarezAccording to the FARC, the assassinations and forced disappearances escalated after far-right President Ivan Duque, whose party fiercely opposed the peace process, took office.At the moment, “one former FARC-EP combatant dies every five days,” the prosecutor of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), Giovanni Alvarez, told the court.While the killings are fueling FARC members to abandon the process, the killings also reduces the chances of victims to find out with loved one who were, for example, murdered or kidnapped. Every time a former FARC combatant is killed, the truth about one or a group of victims is silenced. This situation makes it difficult to construct the truth.JEP Prosecutor Giovanni AlvarezA government in chaosMartha Mancera (Image: Twitter)When asked about the specific assassination of 19 of these former guerrillas, Deputy Prosecutor General Martha Mancera said that “in some cases we needed to send 10 warnings in which we told” the National Protection Unit (UNP) that the risk of assassination was “extreme.”In regards to the UNP, which has been under fire for its ineffectiveness for years, “we have to say unfortunately: the results of immediate protection or specialized management security schemes are not very fast.”Mancera’s results weren’t much better as she was forced to admit that no more than 37 people were convicted for either killing or threatening FARC members.Duque’s peace process adviser, Emilio Archila, was forced to admit that the government failed to create new formal reintegration spaces where FARC members would be able to count on special protection after abandoning the reintegration spaces agreed in the 2016 peace deal.Excuses for not dismantling paramilitariesPeace commissioner Miguel CeballosPeace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos, the government’s highest peace official, baffled by falsely claiming that the National Commission for Security Guarantees, which seeks to define policies to dismantle paramilitary groups, also meant to “dismantle groups like the ELN.”Duque, who received the help of a successor group of paramilitary organization AUC,  is obliged to convene this commission on a monthly bases, but has only done so three times.According to Ceballos, dismantling the paramilitary groups once promoted by Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, was complicated because “there exists no legal definition that tells us which of these groups are successor groups of paramilitarism.”Peace organization Defendamos la Paz on Tuesday requested the United Nations Security Council to increase pressure on the government to take effective action against the paramilitary groups closely associated with Duque’s far-right party, the Democratic Center.

" Fewer than 150 people watched President Ivan Duque’s COVID show on YouTube on Wednesday as the brainchild of his troubled propaganda chief Hassan Nassar, is failing.Duque hired the former commentator of government-friendly television network RCN Television in January in the hope Nassar could improve the president’s abysmal approval rating.The president’s attempts to violently crack down on massive anti-government protests in late 2019 had sunk the far-right president’s approval rating to a record low.Nassar had always been an outspoken supporter of the president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, and took the challenge, and failed miserably.The coronavirus pandemic provided a unique opportunity to position Duque not as a mafia puppet, but a leader.In order to do this, the president’s propaganda chief restarted the daily online presidential broadcast Duque’s previous propaganda chief introduced during the 2019 protests, but abandoned after its pilot episode.The crisis boosted the approval rating of the president to a record high of 52%, considerably less than those of mayors who had taken measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus ahead of Duque.The mayors’ actions apparently had more impact than the president’s show, but Nassar’s job was to improve Duque’s image, not to tell the president what to do.The government’s failure to respond to the coronavirus and increased violence attributed to Duque’s failure to implement a 2016 peace deal quickly ended the president’s short-lived approval.When local media revealed that Duque’s propaganda chief had used peace funds to to improve the president’s image, Duque’s public approval dropped even further.Furthermore, the president’s COVID show only confirmed claims Duque was afraid to leave the presidential palace.Instead of leading Colombia through the biggest crisis in recent memory, the president was hosting Nassar’s show that was losing audience every day.By October, the president’s approval rating was at 31% and dropping.While more than 100,000 people watched “Me Dicen Wally,” a political satire show on Wednesday, less than 150 people watched Duque’s COVID show.Nassar, in the meantime, has become one of Duque’s most ridiculed aides, especially after claiming that more than a million people in Choco received government aid. The Pacific province only has 600,000 inhabitants.

" Colombia’s former chief prosecutor can expect high treason charges for seeking to end the peace process in collusion with the DEA, according to the opposition.In a bombshell debate, opposition senators revealed more evidence of a conspiracy between former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez and the DEA that all but sunk the country’s peace process.The conspiracy to frame former leaders of demobilized FARC guerrillas in the middle of a peace process add to multiple attempts of Martinez to push the country back into war and jointly justify high treason charges, according to Green Alliance Senator Antonio Sanguino.We are talking about an official who seriously endangered national security and the national sovereignty and this, as my colleague Ivan Cepeda said, constitutes high treason.Senator Antonio Sanguino (Green Alliance)Fury and confusion over DEA plot that all but sunk Colombia’s peace processIllegal operation began in 2016 alreadyOpposition Senator Gustavo Petro. (Image: Senate)Opposition Senator Gustavo Petro said that the prosecution began illegally wiretapping the FARC’s former political chief, “Ivan Marquez” less than two weeks after they signed peace with former President Juan Manuel Santos in late 2016.Former US District Attorney Geoffrey Bergman and DEA agent Brian Witek lied to a grand jury in early 2018 in order to indict FARC leader “Jesus Santrich” and justify an extradition request, according to Petro.The DEA and Martinez initially tried to incriminate Marquez, who was chosen by the FARC’s members to become their senate leader, the opposition senator said.When this failed, Colombia’s former chief prosecutor and US officials allegedly decided to fabricate evidence against Santrich.Martinez resigned in May last year after Colombia’s war crimes tribunal ordered an investigation against him and the DEA agents involved in the operation.Marquez, Santrich and at least 20 other former FARC commanders abandoned the peace process and rearmed in August last year.DEA all but destroyed Colombia’s peace process for no apparent reasonThe organized crime of Martinez and DEAFormer chief prosecutor and alleged fraudster Nestor Humberto MartinezColombia’s chief prosecutor pretended not to be facing a maximum of 15 years in prison, not counting possible convictions over other attempts to undermine the peace process and a flurry of corruption claims.In an attempt to negate overwhelming evidence, Martinez claimed the lawmakers “are inventing a plot in the defense of the drug traffickers.”Marquez and Santrich have admitted responsibility for heinous war crimes, but the evidence indicates that the Department of Justice requested that prosecutor Bertha Neira delivered cocaine to an undercover DEA agent in an illegal attempt to blame this on demobilized guerrilla leaders.Statements by Witek leaked to the Colombian press contradict the evidence, indicating that the DEA agent gave false testimony while taking part in a political hit job instead of law enforcement.Former ambassador Kevin Whitaker left Colombia when the war crimes tribunal found out about the plot last year already. Witek and other alleged co-conspirators presumably have also left to evade criminal charges.Martinez seemed in denial about the bulk of evidence indicating the former chief prosecutor could be one the biggest criminals of the 21st century.

" Colombia’s Sergio Arboleda University is the alma mater of far-right President Ivan Duque and notorious for its ties to organized crime.Named after a notoriously anti-democrat who violently opposed the abolition of slavery, the university enjoys virtually no academic recognition with the exception of its statistics department.Sergio ArboledaSergio ArboledaSergio Arboleda is mainly remembered as a 19th century rancher, scholar and journalist from Popayan, but was also an illegal slave trader who violently opposed abolition.Arboleda was one of the main leaders of a failed attempt to revoke the abolition of slavery by military means in the Wat of 1851.After losing the anti-abolitionist war, Arboleda and his brother Julio dedicated themselves to the illegal slave trade until the 1870’s.The university appears on the CV of Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, and a number of imprisoned and investigated former officials close to the former Medellin Cartel associate.A year after a former erotic dancer granted Uribe an honorary degree in journalism, “the Sergio” granted Uribe an honorary degree in Hotel and Tourism Management a day for the former president stepped down in 2010.Colombia owes tourism, which provides so many opportunities, only and exclusively to the heroism of the Military and Police.Former President Alvaro UribeStepmom from hell: from burlesque dancer to university rector to jailbirdThe mafia’s universityThe Sergio’s law faculty has received no academic recognition, but has produced a large number of government officials who sought their luck on the wrong side of the law.For them, rector Jorge Noguera and Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, one of Uribe’s Democratic Center party’s founders, created the “Just Cause Foundation.”This NGO bankrolled the criminal defense of former intelligence chief Maria del Pilar Hurtado and former financial crime chief Mario Aranguren, but without any luck. Both were sentenced to prison.Noguera may need the foundation for himself because he has been embroiled in a scandal over the bribery of Supreme Court judges since last year. Zuluaga and Duque have been implicated in the Odebrecht bribery scandal since 2018.The university’s former vice-rector and former Constitutional Court magistrate Jorge Pretelt, a personal friend of Uribe, is in prison for corruption, as well as former economy professor and former Agriculture Minister Andres Felipe Arias, a.k.a. “Uribito.”The father of Ernesto Lucena was a Medellin Cartel associate, but Duque’s sports minister studied law at the Sergio just like Senator Richard Aguilar, whose father laundered money for narcos.Senator Jose Obdulio Gaviria, the late cartel boss Pablo Escobar’s cousin, is a regular speaker at the university as well as far-right former Interior Minister Fernando Londoño, who has been convicted of corruption.The sins of Colombia’s ruling class: The Aguilar familyThe “Sergista” rule of lawProsecutor General Francisco BarbosaDuque appointed Francisco Barbosa as Prosecutor General in February after which Duque’s law school buddy turned the prosecution into a political persecution apparatus.Barbosa appointed the university rector’s wife, Zayda Barrero, as transitional justice chief, but was forced to revoke this within a week.His delegate before the Supreme Court, Sergista criminal law graduate Gabriel Jaimes, was supposed to keep an eye on the Supreme Court, which was trying Uribe for fraud and bribery, but was also revoked.Jaimes returned to the university to study criminal proceedings, but was called back to prosecute Duque’s political patron after the Supreme Court referred the case to a lower court.Barbosa is also supposed to investigate the president’s former public television chief, Juan Pablo Bieri, another allegedly criminal Sergista like Duque and Jaimes.Meanwhile, the protection of human rights of Colombian citizens have fallen in the hands of Sergista Ombudsman Alberto Camacho who dropped the Odebrecht investigation against Duque and Zuluaga when he was a magistrate at the National Electoral Council.Colombia’s chief prosecutor too busy harassing critics to fight crime?The halfway house for sacked officialsMiguel Ceballos (Image: President’s Office)Until Duque became president, the Sergio Arboleda was sort of a halfway house for officials close to Uribe who were sacked after former President Juan Manuel Santos took office.Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos, for example, got a job as law teacher after he lost his job at the Interior Ministry in 2010.Comptroller General consultant Luis Felipe Muergueitio got an undefined job at the university after trying to ban Colombia Reports from the country in 2017.How Colombia is preventing you from knowing the truth about the countryDuque’s “Sergista” prideRector Jorge Noguera and President Ivan DuqueWhen the university awarded Duque in 2017, the president claimed “I have had a career that allowed me to study at the best universities in the United States, I have written five books and have accumulated more than 14 years as a columnist.””A year later, Duque dropped the false claim about his fictitious Masters degree at Harvard. The president’s understanding of “book” may also be taken with pinch of salt, unlike his mafia ties.“Maquiavelo in Colombia” was largely a compilation of other politicians’ theses that was reviewed only by “Sergista” Jorge Mario Eastman, who would later become the president’s chief of staff.The Sergio published only 100 copies of Duque’s “Monetary Sins,” “The Orange Economy” was primarily written by vice-Minister of Culture Felipe Buitrago, “The Orange Effect” was a compilation of columns and “Indignaction” would better be described as a PowerPoint presentation.I must say that my biggest pride is to be a “Sergista.”President Ivan Duque educationorganized crime ",https://colombiareports.com/sergio-arboleda-university-educating-colombias-mafia/,Sergio Arboleda University: educating Colombia’s mafia

" Colombia’s government spun a new conspiracy theory on Sunday, claiming that Venezuelan refugees would be part of a plot to rig the 2022 elections.According to government-loyal newspaper El Tiempo, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro would be planning to coerce people fleeing his country to influence the elections.The newspaper of Duque’s financial patron reported that the president has information “from a very good source” about Maduro’s alleged conspiracy.The five families who own the news in ColombiaVenezuelans and Colombians all look the same?Special permission for Venezuelan citizensThis plot would allegedly involve dozens of corrupt registry officials granting documents illegally and hundreds of thousands of refugees who would obey orders from the neighboring country.To sustain this claim, El Tiempo produced a handful of ID’s allegedly granted to Venezuelan intelligent officials illegally.The newspaper reported that more than 300,000 Venezuelans would have the right to vote, which is false as only Colombian citizens who returned from the neighboring country would have this right.Venezuelan refugees have been given a special permit, which does not give them the right to obtain residency, let alone citizenship or the right to vote.More than half of Venezuela’s refugees in Colombia at risk of starvation: UNRevoking right to vote?National Registrar Alexander VegaRegistrar Alexander Vega is even considering refusing Colombian citizens their right to vote, according to El Tiempo, which would be a major violation of their constitutional rights.The unpopular and increasingly authoritarian Duque may be nervous his far-right party will lose power as it is battered by corruption investigations, including election fraud.The president on multiple occasions has been fabricating conspiracy theories involving Venezuela either to discredit his Venezuelan counterpart or to violate Colombian citizens’ rights to protest against his unpopular government, for example.Whether Duque will be able to to refuse Colombian citizens their right to vote may be a bridge too far though, as congressional opposition against the far-right president is fierce. 2022 electionselection fraudVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-may-refuse-right-to-vote-to-citizens-who-fled-venezuela/,Colombia may refuse right to vote to citizens who fled Venezuela
" Venezuela’s security forces said Wednesday that they have killed a senior FARC dissident commander who rearmed with “Ivan Marquez” last year.“El Loco Ivan” was allegedly killed with four other FARC dissidents in a firefight with Venezuelan security forces on Saturday in Angostura, a municipality in the east of the country.“El Loco” would be the first of a group of 20 who announced the formation of the “La Nueva Marquetalia” dissident group to be killed since their formation in August last year.Colombian authorities have long claimed that Marquez and his men were in Venezuela, but receiving protection from the government of authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro.El Loco took part in the peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC, the guerrilla group that demobilized in 2017.Who the former FARC members of the new dissident group areThe FARC dissident led the former guerrillas’ reintegration in La Macarena, a rural municipality in the central Meta province until July 2018, two months after the US government requested the extradition of “Jesus Santrich” on bogus drug trafficking charges.Santrich was released and disappeared early last year. Both reappeared with Marquez in a video in which they called on other demobilized FARC guerrillas to rearm.So far, this attempt has failed as FARC leaders rushed to prevent mass desertion and Marquez failed to seal an alliance with the Southwestern Bloc, a group that rejected the 2016 peace deal since the beginning.The Southwestern Bloc, which is led by “Ivan Mordizco” and “Gentil Duarte,” was able to expand its territorial control in the lawless south of the country.Marquez and his group only received the support of the rearmed 18th Front in the north of the Antioquia province and the 28th Front in the eastern Vichada province.Since their rearmament, Nueva Marquetalia committed no attacks unlike group believed to have joined the Southwestern Bloc. armed conflictFARC dissidentsnewsletterNueva MarquetaliaVenezuela ",https://colombiareports.com/venezuela-claims-killing-dissident-farc-commander/,Venezuela claims killing dissident FARC commander

" A DEA plot that all but destroyed Colombia’s peace process is causing fury and confusion in the South American country.The publication of evidence that the US counternarcotics agency was trying to frame the former political leaders of demobilized FARC guerrillas “Ivan Marquez” and “Jesus Santrich” caused chaos in Bogota.Colombia’s opposition called top government officials to Congress to respond about the allegedly illegal DEA operation that triggered the FARC’s former political chiefs to rearm last year.The president of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), magistrate Eduardo Cifuentes, said in a press conference that the prosecution withheld the evidence revealed by newspaper El Espectador on Sunday.DEA all but destroyed Colombia’s peace process for no apparent reasonFormer chief prosecutor Nestor Humberto Martinez, who alleged conspired with the DEA, told El Espectador he was unaware that the Americans were using prosecution facilities to illegally wiretap the former FARC leaders.Martinez’ successor, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, will have to explain this to Congress.Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos, Justice Minister Wilson Ruiz, Inspector General Fernando Carrillo and the JEP President were also summoned by the opposition.According to center-right Senator Roy Barreras, “the 22,000 hours of recordings would prove that the former Prosecutor’s Office and the DEA took part in undercover and entrapment operations to discredit the peace process.”The war crimes tribunal discovered irregularities last year already and ordered an investigation against the DEA agents allegedly involved in the operation and Martinez, who immediately resigned.How the DEA and Colombia’s prosecution could have broken the law in attempt to nab FARC leaderWashington DC and the US Embassy went mute after claiming that Santrich was conspiring to traffic cocaine to the US for more than a year contrary to evidence.While the evidence revealed by El Espectador confirmed indications the DEA and the prosecution were trying to frame the FARC’s purported leaders in the Senate and House of Representative, many questions remain.It is not clear, for example, who masterminded the operation that all but sunk the peace process less two months before the 2018 presidential election.

" Five families control almost all of Colombia’s media, using them to amplify their political clout and promote their business empires’ products and services.Sarmiento ClanLuis Carlos Sarmiento is the richest and arguably the most powerful man in Colombia.Having bankrolled all presidential elections since the late 1990’s has done his family well, albeit at times at the cost of the country.Sarmiento gained most his wealth as a government contractor after which he went into banking, which allowed him to bankroll elections and be granted even most construction contracts, until he owned more than half of Colombia’s banks and ran financial operations throughout the Americas and Caribbean tax havens.Sarmiento has always been able to keep a low profile until recently when Grupo Aval, which is run by his son Jr., found itself embroiled in the Odebrecht bribery scandal. Other construction jobs that had gone awry added to public discontent.The construction mogul turning banking mogul is the unchallenged financial patron of President Ivan Duque. His son is reportedly being investigated by both US and Colombian authorities on corruption charges.Ardila ClanCarlos Ardila Lulle is Colombia’s fourth richest man, according to Forbes, whose financial growth in the 1990’s has been marred by allegations of being a major sponsor of paramilitary death squads.Ardila’s news media became controversial after they were used by leaders of paramilitary AUC to justify terrorism. Several of Colombia’s most controversial and notoriously dishonest journalists spent much of their career with Ardila’s news media.Ardila controls much of the food chain of his food an beverage industry, from sugar plantation to sugary drinks. The controversial oligarch has been at odds for occupying indigenous lands for sugar plantation and has been scolded for using indigenous children suffering malnutrition as human Guinea pigs for one of his products.Santo Domingo ClanThe Santo Domingo family is one of the more liberal oligarchical families, unlike the staunchly conservative and authoritarian Ardila and Sarmiento families.The family fortune is mainly the work of the late family patriarch Julio Mario Santo Domingo, a cousin of late President Alfonso Lopez. Following the death of Julio Mario Jr., the family fortunate and businesses are maintained by the patriarch’s second son Alejandro.Santo Domingo spends much of his time in New York.Gilinski ClanJaime Gilinski is Coombia’s second richest man whose companies have been tied to drug money laundering, suspicious accounts in Switzerland and paramilitary groups.The businessman, a friend of former President Alvaro Uribe, also appears to have an extraordinary talent to turn associates into enemies and walk away with their businesses.Immediately after Gilinsky and his father in February 1994 bought a majority stake in Colombia’s largest bank, Bancolombia, the bank immediately began laundering money for the Cali Cartel, according to authorities.In 2003, the family was included in a list of people with questionable banks accounts at the HSBC bank in Geneva, which gave the impression the family were crooks.Family patriarch Isaac Gilinski expressed his irritation with the bad press and said he would buy up media so that they would “tell the truth” and contradict piling money laundering and fraud allegations made by Colombian and US authorities.They don’t have the balls or the courage to tell the truth. Someday I will have media, I am certain. I have already made some proposals.Isaac GilinskiAt the time, Bancolombia was in trouble for its association with pyramid scheme DMG while Gilinski was embroiled in all kinds of fraud scandals.In 2008, more than 20% of deposits made at Bancolombia came from ponzi schemes related to drug trafficking, investigators found out later.The Gilinski family’s appointment of Vicky Davila, a member of the Gnecco crime family, as director of Semana magazine, triggered a mass walkout.The alleged money launderer has no interest of restoring one of Colombia’s most reputable magazine though. The family believes that “polarization is profitable,” according to political news website La Silla Vacia.Char ClanThe clan from Senator Arturo Char has major influence over the media in the Caribbean region through their radio station Olimpica and politics through a network of elected officials.The Senator is currently being investigated by the Supreme Court on election fraud charges while his cousin David has been convicted for ties to paramilitary death squads and his brother Alex is suspected of fraud.The clan is an ally of the government, partially because Char and Duque are embroiled in the same election fraud scandal. journalismmedia ",https://colombiareports.com/the-five-families-who-own-the-news-in-colombia/,The five families who own the news in Colombia

" A court indicted Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe on Friday after the prosecution failed to confirm the far-right politician’s fraud and bribery charges.The Supreme Court had already filed criminal charges and placed Uribe under house arrest, but agreed to transfer his case to a lower court after the far-right politician resigned from the Senate.Uribe’s renunciation of his congressional privileges allowed a Bogota court to lift the house arrest and allow the prosecution to decide whether or not to indict the former president.An appeals court, however, agreed it was up to the prosecution to decide whether to detain Uribe, but that the Supreme Court’s initial indictment was still in place.The ruling forces controversial prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes to proceed with the criminal investigation and disallows him to discard evidence of fraud and bribery gathered by the Supreme Court.The appeals court ruling is a major disappointment for the former president and the prosecution, which seemed reluctant to try the political patron of President Ivan Duque and chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa.The ruling is a major victory for Uribe’s alleged victim, opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, who had filed the appeal.If Jaimes failed to proceed with the trial, the prosecutor could be facing criminal charges as Cepeda’s defense attorneys deem adamant to force the legal system to administer justice.According to the Supreme Court, evidence indicates Uribe filed false criminal charges against the opposition senator based on the testimonies of bribed witnesses to “do away with” Cepeda.Uribe filed these bogus criminal charges against the opposition Senator in 2014, but found himself investigated in 2018 after the Supreme Court found evidence of Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery practices.The investigation ended the alleged criminal’s political career and severely damaged the legitimacy of the president and his far-right Democratic Center party.The former president is now facing three criminal investigations before ordinary justice and one before the Supreme Court over his alleged collusion with a drug traffickers to rig the 2018 elections.

" Ramon Isaza was among the first in Colombia to take up arms against guerrillas and became the latest former paramilitary commander to shake hands with demobilized FARC members.The historic handshake on Friday went as unnoticed as much of the life of “The Old Guy,” who has avoided media attention during much of his life.The 80-year-old Isaza spent much of his adult life in arms, initially as a common soldier and later as one of Colombia’s most senior paramilitary commanders.The man from Magdalena MedioIsaza grew up in Puerto Triunfo, a rural municipality in the heart of the Magdalena Medio region, during “La Violencia,” a decade of extreme partisan violence between liberals and conservatives.This violence was particularly tense in Magdalena Medio because of its strategic location between Bogota and Medellin and because of the presence of the country’s largest oil refinery in the informal regional capital, Barrancabermeja.Isaza was drafted at the end of the civil war and served in the military between 1958 and 1961 as tensions in the countryside continued.The FARC, which was founded in 1964, began an offensive to take control over the region in 1968, extorting large landowners to finance their relatively young guerrilla group.The ELN, which was founded the same year, was mainly influential among oil workers in Barrancabermeja.Isaza and seven of his neighbors founded “Los Escopeteros” in 1977 to protect his municipality from the growing guerrilla threat and violently oppose any other “undesirables” with the financial support the local landlords.Enter the Medellin CartelThe old gate of Hacienda NapolesLate drug lord Pablo Escobar bought the Hacienda Napoles estate in Puerto Triunfo in 1978 and converted his rural estate in the headquarters of his growing drug business.Escobar and his business partners founded their own paramilitary group, “Death to Kidnappers,” or MAS, in response to the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa, a member of the Ochoa Clan, by M-19 guerrillas in November 1981.This paramilitary group that would later become the Medellin Cartel embarked on a terror campaign against anyone deemed a leftist until the M-19 released Ochoa in February 1982.While Los Escopeteros were barely able to defend themselves against attacks from the FARC, the “narco-terrorism” employed by MAS had the M-19 begging for mercy within months.Medellin Cartel boss Gonzalo Rodriguez, a.k.a. “El Mexicano,” and the military helped Henry Perez found the Rural Self-Defense Forces of Puerto Boyaca later that year.After mediation of the Magdalena Medio Ranchers and Farmers Association (Acdegam), Isaza and his 48 subordinates joined Perez in 1984.Financed by the cartel, the paramilitaries were now not just able to defend the land owners’ interests against the guerrillas, but able to expand them with the help of local politicians and the military.This so-called “Puerto Boyaca model” was replicated throughout Antioquia and allowed the creation of paramilitary groups that served both the interests of the Medellin Cartel and the regional elites.NarcoterrorismHenry PerezAccording to Israeli mercenary Yair Klein, he gave Isaza special military training in 1987 two years after Perez founded his first “Armed Combat Formation and Instruction Schools” for paramilitaries and cartel assassins.While the Medellin Cartel used the paramilitary training to embark on a “narco-terrorism” campaign against extradition, local elites would use them to kill political enemies.Perez sent Isaza to the Yari Plains in southern Colombia to train some 90 paramilitary fighters inside FARC-controlled territory.When the now-senior paramilitary commander returned to Puerto Boyaca in 1988, the country was sinking into one of its most violent periods in history.The Medellin Cartel was assassinating policemen left and right while the police and the paramilitaries were on their own anti-subversive terrorism campaign.The violence escalated in 1989 when the cartel assassinated presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan on August 18, bombed Avianca flight 203 on November 27 and bombed the main office of intelligence agency DAS on December 6.The authorities struck back and killed El Mexicano on December 15.Paramilitary emancipationFollowing the killing of the main intermediary between the cartel and the paramilitaries, Perez and Isaza wanted to take a distance from Escobar.The Medellin Cartel founder wanted the opposite and, according to Isaza, demanded that the paramilitaries joined his full-on war against the State.Isaza told the court Escobar expelled him Haciendo Napoles in early 1991 and asked Perez for his head for refusing to join the cartel war against the State.Escobar, who didn’t like me because I patrolled his land and mountains several times, asked Perez and offered him several million for my head, or to let him kill me. Perez got annoyed and refused because he considered me his friend and because I had helped him with the kidnapping of his father.Ramon IsazaWith the paramilitaries now openly against him, the Medellin Cartel founder made a deal with the government that would allow him to be imprisoned in his own prison, “La Catedral,” just outside of Medellin on June 20, 1991.Perez was assassinated exactly a month later in what Isaza believed was a hit ordered by Escobar from prison.Some 700 men of the Self-Defense Forces of Puerto Boyaca, now under the command of “Ariel Otero” agreed to demobilize.The war for Magdalena MedioThe Puerto Boyaca paramilitaries descended into a chaotic turf war after the Cali Cartel ordered Otero’s assassination in January 1992 and Escobar broke prison in July.According to Isaza, he and four other former subordinated of Perez started a war that lasted until the local land owners ordered.Escobar was killed in December 1993, but it took the group of the former Escopeteros commander until the end of 1994 to rid Magdalena Medio of Medellin Cartel remnants.Land owners divided the Magdalena Medio region in three, leaving Isaza in charge of his old stomping ground in eastern Antioquia while giving “Botalon” control over Puerto Boyaca and “El Aguila” control over the Cundinamarca Bloc of the Rural Self Defense Forces of Magdalena Medio (ACMM).The Isaza ClanAccording to the court, Isaza revived the combat training schools Perez originally founded in the 1980’s and gradually took control over the entire ACMM.When “The Old Guy” joined paramilitary organization AUC in 1997, he was already in his late 50’s and put his sons and nephews in charge of the different fronts under his command, creating what is now known as the “Isaza Clan.”When the AUC’s most senior paramilitary commander demobilized in February 2006, he had more than 900 men under his command and had expanded his territory well into the Tolima and Cundinamarca provinces.Isaza was imprisoned to 20 years in prison in 2009 over a 1994 attack on intelligence officials in Antioquia.The former paramilitary commander is suspected of having forcibly disappeared more than 1,500 people and was released from prison to return to his home in Puerto Triunfo in 2016.Some 43 years after “The Old Guy” began fighting the FARC with seven of his neighbors, Isaza welcomed 300 former guerrillas on their way to Bogota to demand an end to the mass killing of demobilized guerrillas.  AUCFARCpeace processRamon Isaza ",https://colombiareports.com/ramon-isaza-the-warlord-who-made-peace-with-farc-43-years-after-taking-up-arms/,"Ramon Isaza, the warlord who made peace with FARC 43 years after taking up arms"
" The evidence of ties between Colombia’s ruling party and drug trafficking is so overwhelming that the prosecution invented more charges against the cops who discovered it.While many consider police investigators Yeferson Fabian Tocarruncho and Wadith Miguel Velasquez heroes, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa rightfully considers them a threat.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersThe “Uribista” house of cardsProsecutor General Francisco Barbosa (Image: Prosecutor General’s Office)Barbosa is one of President Ivan Duque’s best friends and has been implicated in the scandal. Any meaningful investigation into the Democratic Center’s narco plot to rig the 2018 elections could ruin them both.The evidence discovered by the cops about the far-right party plotting with the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa is so compelling it could even send far-right former President Alvaro Uribe, whose drug trafficking ties are almost as old as the cocaine trade, to prison.Prosecuting Tocarruncho and Velasquez on vague criminal charges has more priorities as discrediting their integrity might prevent the entire “Uribista” house of cards come down.Barbosa’s office had already charged them for illegally wiretapping three policemen while investigating corruption, but said Thursday it will charge them for allegedly wiretapping five colleagues.The ties between Colombia’s government and organized crimeFinding evidence against Uribe has consequencesMaria Claudia Daza (L) and Alvaro UribeWiretapping Uribe’s former personal assistant, Maria Daza, and late money launderer Jose Guillermo Hernandez talking about moving money around presumably for vote-buying has consequences.In fact, finding evidence of Uribe’s allegedly crime-ridden past can get you killed.Eight potential witnesses who could confirm claims and evidence that the Uribe family has been at the center of organized crime in their home Antioquia province Since the 1970’s have either been assassinated or extradited to the United States.The former President’s former chief of staff died in the mysterious helicopter crash allegedly after Uribe ordered Medellin crime lord “Don Berna” to kill his former right-hand man.How Colombia’s former president helped kick-start the Medellin CartelBarbosa may not be the type to assassinate witnesses, but the allegedly chief prosecutor has yet to show an interest in pursuing justice rather than impunity and perpetual scorn.Unfortunately for Uribe, his case is being investigated by the Supreme Court, which has never shown much interest in politics. 2018 electionselections fraudFrancisco BarbosaIvan DuqueJose Guillermo HernandeznarcopoliticsProsecutor General's Office ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-doubles-down-on-trying-to-make-presidents-narco-ties-go-away/,Colombia doubles down on trying to make president’s narco ties go away
" US President-elect Joe Biden is likely to put more pressure on Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque to implement peace policies and combat drug trafficking.US foreign policy on Colombia is unlikely to change substantially as this historically has been defined by US Congress.None of the aid cuts proposed by outgoing President Donald Trump, for example, made it through the capitol.Also the outgoing US president’s criticism of the peace process found little support in US Congress.‘Tensions between US and Colombia over counternarcotics disaster’Less narco-politicsLate mafioso Jose Guillermo Hernandez (R) and President Ivan Duque. (Image: Instagram)What is likely to change is the US Government’s scrutiny on Bogota’s spending on American counternarcotics funds and an end to support for Duque’s far-right agenda.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released two damning reports on Washington DC’s drug policy in Colombia, for example.Trump was willing to look away as long as Duque supported The White House’s hardline stance on Venezuela, but Biden has shown little interest in this.Instead, the US president-elect appears to be more in line with his own country’s Congress and that of Colombia where the main concerns have been counternarcotics and the South American country’s peace process.In regards to Venezuela, Biden is more likely to force Bogota to join other governments from the Americas and Europe who demand a peaceful end to the crisis in Colombia’s neighbor to the east.Did Trump’s Colombia drug policy fail because of mafia collusion?Duque’s party’s marginalizedFormer President Alvaro Uribe (L) and late money launderer Jose Guillermo HernandezThe outright support of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party for Trump’ reelection campaign is likely to further marginalize the party and could officials who allegedly meddled in the US elections their job.The future of Colombia’s notoriously inept Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, who has been bungling counternarcotics efforts, has also become less certain.This may actually be beneficial for the president, who could regain legitimacy and popularity by prioritizing US interests over his party’s — sometimes criminal — interests.US House threatens to cut aid for Colombia over failing peace policies, human rights violationsA strong and legitimate allyPresident Ivan Duque (L) and his US counterpart Donald Trump (Image: President’s Office)Leading members of Colombia’s opposition have been outspoken about their support for Biden, hoping the president-elect will strengthen the country’s peace process.This process that began after a peace deal between former FARC guerrillas and former President Juan Manuel Santos includes a counternarcotics strategy that prioritizes crop substitution, which is widely considered more effective that the forced eradication and aerial spraying Trump and Duque have pursued.Ultimately, it would be in Washington DC’s interest to make sure Colombia is a strong ally, not a liability because of Duque’s alleged ties with the mafia. foreign relationsJoe BidenUnited StatesUS foreign policy ",https://colombiareports.com/how-bidens-election-may-affect-colombia/,How Biden’s election may affect Colombia
" Evidence obtained by newspaper El Espectador confirmed that the DEA all but destroyed Colombia’s peace process in a plot that would make a B-movie look classy.Colombia’s war crimes tribunal ordered an investigation into former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez and several DEA agents for the allegedly illegal operation in May last year after the court discovered the plot.By then, however, Martinez, former US District Attorney Geffrey Bergman and a several DEA agents had already done irreparable damage to the peace process with demobilized FARC guerrillas.Did Trump’s Colombia drug policy fail because of mafia collusion?DEA begins plotting days after Trump took officeJesus SantrichPreviously released evidence indicated that the DEA and the nephew of the FARC’s former political chief, “Ivan Marquez,” sought to frame former guerrilla ideologue “Jesus Santrich.”The new evidence, however, makes it painfully clear Colombia’s peace process nearly fell apart over a DEA conspiracy that makes your average B-movie come across as credible.Did a DEA hoax devastate Colombia’s peace process?Highlights of the DEA’s B-movie conspiracyColombia’s prosecution legally dealt drugs to the DEA.A person impersonating Ivan Marquez ended up talking to DEA agents impersonating Mexican narcos.The DEA didn’t seem to care which former guerrilla leader to screw over.Marquez nephew didn’t confirm the US Attorney’s indictment against Santrich until after he was flown to the USHow the DEA kills peace processesMarlon MarinOn January 25, 2017, five days after outgoing President Trump took office, Colombia’s prosecution began wiretapping Marquez’s nephew, Marlon Marin, on suspicion he was trying to embezzle funds meant for healthcare for demobilized guerrillas.Within a month, Marin was recorded talking to a man with a Central American accent about laundering money that involved a US citizen, Vicent Schifano.The American sought to launder money via a Venezuelan Bank and one from Panama. According to El Espectador, this may have been a money laundering operation that was discovered by Venezuelan authorities, who arrested the director of the Banesco Bank in an operation against “the mafias stealing and devaluating Venezuela’s currency,” according to Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.Marin and two businessmen from Cali, Armando Gomez and Fabio Younes, retook the money laundering attempts in June, which included “five TV’s.” The prosecution has always sustained this referred to five kilograms of cocaine, but El Espectador reported this most likely referred to $5 million that required laundering.One August 14, Younes told Marquez’ nephew he had talked to Mexican emissaries, presumably a DEA agent, who offered that “he would take care of the payment of the five TV’s to Armando so that Armando can give them to you.”On September 18, both men confirmed that the Mexicans would be coming to Colombia.Enter the cocaineFormer chief prosecutor and alleged frauster Nestor Humberto MartinezDuring a September 25 meeting, Mexican DEA agents reportedly gave Marin $25,000 to get them five kilograms of cocaine.The federal agents received this cocaine from Colombian prosecution officials on November 1, according to court documents obtained by El Espectador.Marin would claim that this cocaine came from Santrich after having turning into a government witness against the FARC leader.The DEA said in 2018 that Santrich “met with the buyers of the cocaine at [Santrich’s] residence. During the meeting, [Santrich] acknowledged that they provided cocaine to others, and directed the other co-conspirator to coordinate a larger quantity of cocaine.” El Tiempo reported in 2018. Of this alleged meeting, however, exists no evidence.DEA begins screwing upThe evidence that does exist of that day is Younes telling Marin he didn’t trust the DEA officials and wanted to be certain who they were. The FARC leader’s nephew said “that’s all sorted,” but the businessmen insisted he wanted out.What I say is that I’m out because they are not well identified. If you know who they are, if you have them identified, I’ll stay calm. But be careful, because they’ll come with stories that their father is such and so and all that, and I want to know if they are real or not.Fabio YounesIn a phone call from New York, the federal agent on December 7 identified himself as the son of Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro of the Sinaloa Cartel as also Marin began had lost faith, mainly in Schifano for talking too much when receiving the laundered $5 million they had begun negotiating in June.He arrived asking all kinds of things, first asking that this money was going to be given to him to buy some things, that this money was to get into the hands of my relative, he mentioned my name, that he was aware of that, and that he didn’t want any intermediaries.Marlin MarinPeople are telling me that my friend (Schifano) thought that this money was of you guys, but he was said it wasn’t, that it was to pay for something. He, just so you know, also said that he never sat down with either the man with the glasses (Santrich) or your uncle.Undercover DEA agentDEA wraps things up, amateur-styleThe DEA was bungling the entire case and began pressuring Marin to arrange a meeting with Santrich, which he did in a phone call in February 1, the first time Marin was recorded talking to the former FARC leader.Because Santrich had to leave for Barranquilla, he agreed to meet for five minutes on February 8 to discuss “work projects,” presumably for reintegrating FARC guerrillas.Our friends who got you that bottle as a present the other time are here in Bogota, right? So, they tell me that they only ask for five minutes with you so you can tell them that we will begin with the projects… So they tell me “We only need him for five minutes. We won’t talk about anything else, just that he confirms that everything is ready to begin working on the productive projects we were considering, so we can begin working.” It’s all they need.Marlon MarinThe prosecution didn’t release this audio until October 2018 as it was obvious neither Marin nor the FARC leader agreed to meet with the undercover DEA agent to discuss any kind of criminal activity.DEA agent Brian Witek took a photo of the meeting and testified that Santrich agreed to traffic 10 tons of cocaine to the US, but evidence of this has yet to emerge.Setting up the snitchesControversial former US prosecutor Geoffrey Bergman. (Image: Wikipedia)Federal agents called Schifano on February 13, 2018 to meet them in Miramar, Florida, where he received a new car and $5 million in fake money. The New York resident accepted the money, according to El Espectador, after which the agents confiscated his car.Controversial former US Attorney Geoffrey Bergman charged Shifano with conspiracy to commit a crime with Marin on April 9, the same day the FARC leader was arrested in Colombia.“As alleged,” Bergman said on April 10, “these defendants conspired to ship thousands of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia to the streets of the U.S.  Thanks to the investigative work of the DEA, they are now under arrest and face significant criminal charges.”A subordinate of the prosecutor arrested the New York native in Miami the same day to make sure Shifano would testify against Marin, who in turn would testify against Santrich.By then, Bergman, the DEA and Martinez, who is suspected of all kinds of criminal activity, had all but killed Colombia’s peace process. Why they would do such a thing is entirely unclear.

" Colombia’s former FARC guerrillas have admitted responsibility for two assassination attempts on former Vice-President German Vargas.The dynasty politician has yet to respond to the letter of FARC leader Rodrigo Londoño to former President Juan Manuel Santos in which the president of the former guerrillas’ party said he would ask Santos’ former VP for forgiveness as part of an ongoing peace process.We also have a debt with you and your government. Since we signed the Agreement, we knew this moment would come and we are going to pay it off in order to comply.FARC president Rodrigo LondoñoThe attacksRodrigo Londoño (Image: Twitter)The dynasty politician lost several fingers as a consequence of a 2002 bomb book attack and suspected paramilitaries and now-defunct intelligence agency DAS of being behind the 2005 car bomb attack that almost killed several of the then-senator’s bodyguards.Londoño, the FARC’s last military commander, claimed the FARC was responsible for both assassination attempts and said he would cooperate with the country’s war crimes tribunal and truth commission to remove all doubt about the former guerrillas’ responsibility.The latest surprise confession adds to previous public statements in which the FARC claimed responsibility for several high-profile assassinations of which most were never solved.The murder of Alvaro Gomez: FARC rip open victims’ wounds after 25 yearsThe investigations(Image: JEP)All publicly made confessions will have to be investigated by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), which will ultimately decide if FARC admissions and denials are true or false.Vargas’ political party, Radical Change (CR), on multiple occasions sought to strip the JEP of powers, but without success.CR’s objections to the JEP brought the former VP closer to far-right former president Alvaro Uribe with whom Vargas had strained relations after the 2005 bomb attack.The former VP’s vast network of electoral barons was key in the 2018 election victory of President Ivan Duque, one of Uribe’s disciples.CR’s decision last year to join Duque’s coalition gave the president a majority in Congress who had been trying to govern with a congressional minority for a year.The powers behind the throne of Colombia’s presidentVargas’ party and Uribe’s far-right Democratic Center party are currently under investigation over election fraud allegations.The FARC, which has become part of the congressional opposition for Duque, is being investigated for countless crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the former guerrillas during the armed conflict. armed conflictFARCGerman VargasRodrigo LondoñoWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/farc-admits-assassination-attempts-on-colombias-former-vp/,FARC admits responsibility for assassination attempts on Colombia’s former VP
" Colombia’s far-right former President Alvaro Uribe may have been forced out of politics, but that won’t stop him from attacking his country’s peace process.In a video message, Uribe revived proposals to to roll back 2016 agreements made with demobilized FARC guerrillas, strip the judicial branch of its independence and reduce Congress through a referendum.The former president’s “Let’s Take Care of The Amazon!” proposal would also seek to end “political indoctrination” in public education and eradicate poverty through a minimum income.The former president suggested that President Ivan Duque may sign his allegedly criminal patron’s proposals into law by decree if a referendum fails or congress sinks the proposals as before.Killing the peace processUribe proposed to “abolish” the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) that is part of the peace process and transfer its investigations into war crimes to the ordinary court system, except those of the security forces.These investigations should be transferred to a “special chamber” with “impartial magistrates” with knowledge about military command structures and codes of conduct within the military, according to Uribe.The former president additionally proposed parole for military war criminals or suspected war criminals who have been in jail for more than five years, which would mainly benefit commanders who committed crimes under Uribe’s watch.Last but not least, Uribe proposed to bar anyone found guilty of crimes against humanity from entering Congress, which would effectively remove most of the FARC’s lawmakers from Congress who have already plead guilty before the JEP in order to be allowed into Congress.Killing justiceThe former president proposed to strip the judicial branch of its judicial independence by giving Congress the right to approve or disapprove of magistrates’ elections.Instead of three high courts, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and the State Council, Uribe proposed to have “one or two” high courts that would be excluded from electing, for example, a Prosecutor General.Uribe also proposed a Privileged Tribunal that would allow a retrial for convicted or congressmen, governors and magistrates.This would also largely benefit the former president’s criminal allies who have been convicted by the Supreme Court on corruption charges or because they colluded with death squads.Killing governmentUribe additionally proposed to reduce Congress by 30% in order to have a “less bureaucratic, more social State.”Combined with cutting the number of state officials, this would allow for an increase in investment, according to the former president.Killing public educationClaiming that teachers union Fecode “has substituted science and the freedom of education for political indoctrination,” Uribe wants to step up the privatization of education and the issuing of grants that would allow children from poor families to attend private schools.

Colombia needs more judges, more judicial deconcentration, more decentralization, more access to justice, more local justice and of course more resources.Inspector General Fernando CarrilloThe ‘Uribistas’ opposition to justiceInspector General Fernando CarrilloUribe and his far-right Democratic Center party have opposed the transitional justice system ever since it was conceived during peace talks between former President Juan Manuel Santos and the now-demobilized FARC guerrilla group.Duque has tried to limit the JEP’s power and underfund the court on multiple occasions, but without success as the transitional justice system is supported by Congress and the international community.Duque dismissed after slamming Colombia’s war crimes tribunalThe ICC’s deputy prosecutor warned that if for some reason the JEP would cease to function as it should, the international court in The Hague could assume the investigations into war crimes committed during Colombia’s armed conflict.When the JEP was created, the authorities developed a system of accountability that can deal with that vast universe of crimes. This is how a new jurisdiction sanctions conduct that would otherwise fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC.ICC Deputy Prosecutor James StewartDuque and his political patron have opposed the JEP because it does not only investigate crimes committed by the FARC, but also by the State, which directly affects Uribe.The military carried out some of the worst atrocities of the armed conflict under the former president, who is investigated for his alleged complicity in three massacres and a homicide. armed conflictJEPpeace processWar Crimes ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-war-crimes-tribunal-receives-back-up-after-far-right-attacks/,Colombia’s war crimes tribunal receives back-up after far-right attacks
" Public support for Colombia’s security forces has dropped to a historic low less than a year after notoriously inept Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo took office.The defense minister was already considered “a disaster” by Foreign Minister Claudia Blum after she replaced the tragically uncharismatic politician last year.Pollster Gallup last week implicitly confirmed Blum’s claim when revealing that public support for the military under Trujillo’s watch had dropped to 48% for the first time in recorded history.Demagogy, lies, destructive populism, slander, the defense of policies that affect the fight against illicit crops and the project that seeks to stigmatize and delegitimize the Public Force are the worst security threat to Colombians who want to live and work in peace.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes TrujilloApproval rating of Colombia’s militaryLess popular than Trump evenThe military’s approval rating is still better than the 20% of the defense minister, who has become even less popular even than incumbent US President Donald Trump, the least popular foreign leader after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.Maduro and Trump were never popular, but Colombia’s military has enjoyed a high approval ratings for decades until President Ivan Duque put a number of allegedly corrupt generals in charge of the National Army, which led from one embarrassment to the other.Most importantly, guerrilla group ELN and dissident factions of the demobilized guerrilla group FARC made major territorial expansions, pushing Colombia’s cocaine production to a record high.Colombia’s potential cocaine production reached all-time high in 2019: UNFighting civilians instead of guerrillasDuque made a fool out of himself in August last year when he accused Maduro of harboring terrorists, but was caught using fabricated evidence.Trujillo’s predecessor, former Defense Minister Guillermo Botero, was then forced to resign after Senator Roy Barreras revealed the military had bombed minors who had been forcibly recruited by a FARC dissident.Things went from bad to worse after Trujillo took over in November last year and immediately embarked on a terror campaign in a failed attempt to quell anti-government protests.The National Army commander, former general Nicasio Martinez, was forced to resign almost immediately after because the Supreme Court found out the army had allegedly been spying on journalists, lawmakers and the top court itself.A second scandal revealed the army also had been plotting to assassinate a leading journalist and profiling civilian targets.US Congress to be asked to investigate Colombia’s military mafiaThe minister hits a new lowWhile guerrillas continued their territorial offensive and public security in certain areas continued to worsen, Trujillo appeared to dedicate most his time trying silence any protest.The minister hit a low point in September when National Police massacred at least 13 people in the capital Bogota in an operation led by Trujillo to quell protests that had broken out after an extremely violent case of police brutality.Instead of stepping down, the disgraced minister has since threatened to file criminal charges against critics, including senators, who don’t just want him removed from office, but in prison for terrorism. approval ratingsCarlos Holmes Trujillomilitary ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-military-loses-public-support-as-defense-minister-bungles/,Colombia’s military loses public support as defense minister bungles
" An estimated seven million of Colombia’s 50 million people are starving, according to multiple estimates, without the government formulating any response.Both economic think tank Fedesarollo and the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) believe that more than 14% of the country is living off less than $1.90 a day.While CEPAL believes some 34% of the population, or 17 million are now living below the poverty line, Federasollo investigator Jairo Nuñez believes that this could be between 47% and 49% of the population by the end of the year.Colombia is among the countries in the region where extreme poverty has seen the highest growth, according to CEPAL.Both Nuñez and CEPAL are urging for a minimum income as the social instability caused by poverty levels this high are impossible to predict.Multiple cities, particularly Cartagena where poverty levels historically have been high, are already reporting a surge of violent crime.According to the World Bank, “‘about 10 percent of the poor reside in areas with a conflict history, the majority are in areas with nonrecent conflict” like  Cartagena, implying that the risk of violent crime or a resurgence of armed conflict is possible.Almost immediately after Colombia shut down in March, President Ivan Duque granted monthly stipends of $40 to some 3 million people. Not only is this not enough to eat, the president is letting 4 million people starve.Nuñez told newspaper El Tiempo that the stipend should be double to prevent mass hunger and that “we have proposed that 40 to 50 percent of all households should receive this.”“This would cost 2.5% of the Gross Domestic Product,” said Nuñez.Duque has refused this, however, and is now facing a referendum to have him removed from office and force Congress implement an emergency income as proposed by the Fedesarollo investigator.Colombia’s opposition seeks referendum to remove Duque from officeEconomics professor Jorge Ivan Gonzalez told the newspaper he agreed with a Central Bank proposal to lend money on a large scale, “not to give them to the business like [business association president] Bruce MacMaster says, but to start a public works project that generates immediate employment.If you give money to a shoemaker in the Restrepo neighborhood [in Bogota], he will give it to the owner of the store he’s been fighting with for three months and that’s where the money will stay.Economist Jorge Ivan GonzalezDuque, however, has developed a habit of not listening to economists, but to his financial patrons, making it likely the president will slow down economic recovery even more than necessary. coronaviruspoverty ",https://colombiareports.com/how-long-will-7-million-in-colombia-starve-before-hell-breaks-loose/,How long will 7 million starve before hell breaks loose in Colombia?

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque fiercely attacked his country’s war crimes tribunal while his far-right party seeks to abolish the transitional justice system.The president was invited by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) to discuss transitional justice and took the opportunity to express his frustration about the court’s failure to produce quick results.Colombia’s cyberwar against truth and justiceThe outgoing president of the JEP, magistrate Patricia Linares, with the support of an international panel of experts, dismissed Duque’s diatribe that was riddled with falsehoods.The president and his far-right Democratic party have actively opposed the the JEP and the judicial principle that all are equal before the law.Duque and his party have always sought a differential treatment for crimes committed by state actors presupposing that any action carried out by a government is legal while blurring the line between opposition and crime.The peace process and the transitional justice process in particular have exposed the extent of human rights violations committed by the state, specifically under former president Alvaro Uribe, and its failure to serve justice to victims.Uribe, who is investigated over his alleged involvement in three massacres, a homicide and the formation of a death squad, has consistently rallied to abolish the transitional justice system.Uribe called to testify over 3 massacres 10 years after receiving Medal of FreedomDuque found himself talking to a wall in his latest attempt to discredit the JEP with, for example, UN deputy-Secretary General Amina Mohammed stressing that “a sustainable peace is not possible without justice and reconciliation.”The application of justice is a major problem for Duque as both Uribe, the president’s mentor, and his political allies at risk of being held accountable for alleged crimes they committed.The president and his party, however, have been unable to rewind the JEP despite constant efforts.

They rob us, we replace the material and within a matter of hours, another robbery is registered,” Tigo Une president Marcelo Cataldo said in a press release earlier this week.The Medellin mafia and copperAccording to Tigo Une, the company lost 73,438 meters of cable between January and October in 1,840 robberies of which only 3% took place outside Antioquia. Some 79% of these robberies took place in the capital Medellin.A company spokesperson told Colombia Reports on Thursday that the theft has surged after the coronavirus pandemic plunged much of the city in poverty.However, professional copper thieves had already stepped up the stealing of cables years before the crisis, implying the involvement of organized crime.Tigo Une’s president implied his company’s copper may have become a commodity for transnational crime organizations as Antioquia alone exports multiple times the copper produced in all of Colombia.Although Colombia does not have large copper mines, it exports approximately 50,000 tons of copper annually. Other studies indicate that the country produces about 10,000 tons each year.Tigo Une president Marcelo CataldoAntioquia’s mystery copper exportsCopper mine El RobleColombia’s 10,000 tons of copper were produced in the country’s only copper mine, El Roble, a few miles west of Antioquia, according to the National Mining Agency.This mine belonged to the family of Antioquia Governor Anibal Gaviria until they sold it to a Canadian mining company, Atico Mining Corp, in 2013 when Gaviria was mayor of Medellin.According to the Colombian Mining Information System (SIMCO), Antioquia last year exported three times more copper than Colombia’s entire production, which all went to China.The origin of the 20,000 ton of copper exported from the Gulf of Uraba, where the Gaviria family owns stocks in the local port, is unclear.

" The resignation of Colombia’s central bank president on Friday allowed President Ivan Duque to strip it of its independence and appoint his controversial finance minister.If Duque decides to grant the wish of Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla, the consequences could be catastrophic.The finance minister had already expressed his interest in becoming central bank president last month and also resigned of Friday, ringing alarms throughout the country.Constitutional independenceColombia’s constitution demands the central bank be independent exactly to prevent that a nepotistic or corrupt government controls the country’s gold reserves, monetary policy and cash production.For this reason, the central bank has eight members, one of whom is the finance minister.Duque had already appointed two members and which would appoint another two in 2021, which would give the government already a lot of control.The announcement of central bank president Juan Jose Echavarria to resign would even allow Duque to appoint Carrasquilla, who has the reputation of your average conman, as president.The worst of the worst case scenariosDuque’s two years in office have been marred by nepotism. His alleged corruption has already resulted in four criminal investigations by the House’s Accusations Committee.Carrasquilla’s reputation is possible worse after appearing in the Panama Papers, inventing a financial scheme that bankrupted dozens of municipalities, granting tax discounts to Duque’s financial patrons and basing national budgets on fictitious variables.In short, one would have to rely entirely on trust that neither would pull any of their previous tricks while in control of the country’s monetary policy and gold reserves.All that’s left is prayerWhether Duque appoints his former finance minister as the replacement of Echavarria depends entirely on Duque, who has the choice of perpetuating his nepotism habits or appoint an economist who is not widely considered a tax evading, nepotistic  conman.

In their eagerness to expand and in the absence of control by environmental authorities, these people have managed to take over more portions of land, even draining the water bodies of the Bajo Sinú, San Marcos and the wetlands of Sucre, attempting in this way to take our own lives, given the ancestral importance of these places as sources of subsistence.Zenu peopleGeneral Juan Carlos Ramirez of the 7th Army Division confirmed the massacre and said troops were deployed to the region to protect the local population from possible other outbursts of violence.Ramirez said that investigators had begun a criminal investigation to confirm the reported motive of the massacre and arrest the perpetrators.According to Mendez, however, the surviving victim said that the members of his community who were claiming land they were allegedly promised by the ranchers had been suffering harassment from the military.This victim, Carlos Arturo Valerio, had sued the Mayor’s Office because the landowners occupying the land, the Rivera family, were refusing to comply with court orders.The victims’ rights defenders added that the massacre appeared to be linked to the assassination of land rights defender Hernando Benitez on Tuesday.The massacre is the latest of 34 in a violent escalation of conflict in areas historically abandoned or neglected by the state.  indigenous issuesmassacresSucre ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-34th-massacre-this-year-5-indigenous-murdered-amid-land-dispute/,Colombia’s 34th massacre this year: 5 indigenous murdered amid land dispute

(Image: Senate)This month alone, four activists of Petro’s political movement have been assassinated in what at best appears to be a terror campaign to impede the opposition leader from organizing a bid for the 2022 elections.La Guajira is one of the electoral strongholds of one of Duque’s most vociferous critics, who said on Twitter he would hold the president responsible if anything were to happen with his activists in Guajira.The general command of the Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia would like to inform the public opinion of the province of La Guajira that we have ordered, as an armed response to the various acts of political activism by communist factions, the systematic extermination of each and every one of their activists.

" Colombia’s prosecution has taken the intimidation of press to a whole new level after announcing it would seek criminal charges against a whistleblower and raid the country’s press freedom foundation.The prosecution’s surprise move is a response to the publication of evidence that the former public television director, Juan Pablo Bieri, sought to censor a TV host for criticizing far-right President Ivan Duque.How Duque’s press chief became Colombia’s censorMafias don’t like snitchesDiana DiazIn a press release, the prosecution confirmed it was seeking criminal charges against the former director of public television network Señal Colombia, Diana Diaz, for leaking the evidence to press freedom foundation FLIP.The prosecution also confirmed it sought to raid the FLIP and obtain information on who had visited their office in Bogota but desisted, claiming the press freedom foundation provided the necessary information.The FLIP responded on Twitter that it had opposed the raid and was never informed about the prosecution’s decision to call off the raid.It is difficult not to see these actions as intimidation instigated by whoever was affected by the initial complaint, who currently holds a position in the government.FLIP director Jonathan BockNormalizing authoritarianismThe Organization of American States’ special rapporteur for the freedom of expression, Catalina Botero, said the prosecution “normalized authoritarianism” while violating international norms that seek to protect whistleblowers.“I don’t believe they understand the gravity of the situation,” said Botero.For the Prosecutor’s General’s Office, it is not grave that an inspection of a human rights organization was ordered to find out who entered that organization over a long period of time.

The country’s schools do not have the resources to implement the protocols. We need to think about the health of the children, the teachers and the education workers.Fecode president Nelson AlarconDuque traveled to Quibdo, the capital of the Pacific Choco province, t in his latest attempt to try to ignore the growing pressure on his unpopular government to end its misrule.The president would have to leave that region before Wednesday though as the anti-government protests are expected to be particularly big in the impoverished Pacific city.As the different social organizations are literally sending Duque flying, Ombudsman Carlos Camargo is trying to meet with Duque to mediate between his friend and the native Colombians who demand direct talks with the president over the surrender of land that was promised to them decades ago, the implementation of peace and and end to Duque’s increasing authoritarianism. educationnational strikesocial protests ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-teachers-join-indigenous-increasing-pressure-on-duque/,"Colombia’ teachers join indigenous, increasing pressure on Duque"

Of these people, 7 million people will be trying to survive with $40 a month.Duque said a few days ago that thinking about reform would be clumsy while the pandemic lasts. On his part, in an interview with Dinero, Minister Carrasquilla said that it would be “silly” to do so. I think exactly the opposite: what is clumsy or “silly” is not doing it.Former Finance Minister Mauricio CardenasFedesarollo lowered its growth projection from -3.5% in May to to -7.1% in September.Meanwhile, the IMF lowered its growth projection from -2.4% in April to -8.2% last week while raising that of other countries in the region.For next year, the IMF expects Colombia to increase 4.4%, also considerably lower than the projection of Carrasquilla.The World Bank has been lowering its growth projection from -4.9% in June to -7.2% last week, adding that “a growth rebound is estimated for 2021-2022.In an interview with El Tiempo, Duque said 98% of the economy has been reactivated and to have a reactivation plan of $44 billion, but was unable to give any specifics.Neither the president nor his finance minister seem to have a clue what they’re doing while economic forecasts are worsening and the effects on society are increasingly incalculable.

" Thousands of native Colombians took to the capital Bogota on Wednesday in the latest escalation of tensions between indigenous peoples and President Ivan Duque.The president has so far refused to personally meet with the indigenous leaders who demand action to curb the extreme violence their peoples have been subjected to and consider a genocide.The indigenous leaders additionally demand the government acknowledges their autonomy over lands they were promised decades ago, but the government leased to sugar plantation owners.The “minga,” as the native Colombians’ mobilization is called, puts Duque in a difficult position.The indigenous demand the implementation of a 2016 peace deal with the demobilized FARC guerrilla group, which is fiercely opposed by the president’s far-right Democratic Center party.Among the sugar plantation owners occupying indigenous land are members of Duque’s own government and the owner of RCN, one of the country’s two television networks.In short, if the president effectively surrenders the indigenous’ land he would create division within his government and lose the support of the television network that has been most supportive of his administration.If Duque agreed to implement the peace process, the government would lose support from the president’s own party.To further complicate matters, the arrival of thousands of members of indigenous organizations in Bogota will take place only days before a national strike that has been set for October 21.The indigenous organizations on their way to Bogota are part of the National Strike Committee together with student organizations and labor unions.The students and unions support the indigenous’ land claims and the country’s largest peace movement, Defendamos La Paz, supports the indigenous’ demand to implement the peace deal.The leftist opposition in Congress supports all of the above.The Supreme Court recently condemned the government’s violent crack-down of the largest anti-government protests in more than 40 years organized by the same forces last year.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo and the National Police are being investigated after police massacred at least 13 Bogota residents during protests last month after complaints by Mayor Claudia Lopez, informally the second most powerful official in the country.Without the possibility to simply beat the indigenous out of Bogota, Duque’s refusal to talk to them will be difficult to sustain. indigenous issuesIvan DuqueMinga ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-indigenous-take-to-bogota-to-put-duque-in-the-corner/,Colombia’s indigenous take to Bogota to put Duque in the corner

" Thousands of indigenous people are on their way to Colombia’s capital Bogota to demand, among other things, peace policies that could protect them against drug violence.The native Colombians, specifically members of the Nasa nation, have been hardest hit by violence caused by President Ivan Duque’s failures to implement the country’s 2016 peace deal with demobilized FARC guerrillas.Before the FARC’s demobilization, the indigenous people from the Cauca province were already being threatened by right paramilitary groups over their opposition to large landowners and illegal mining.Abandoned by the StateEver since the beginning of the FARC’s demobilization in January 2017, the Nasa people’s volunteer Indigenous Guard stepped up efforts to prevent other groups from trying to enter their autonomous territories.Far-right President’s Ivan Duque has been reluctant to implement the deal his political party fiercely opposes.The assassinations of native Colombians in the province has tripled since 2016 and is raising suspicions that also the National Army is involved in the regional drug trade that has fueled rearmament of FARC dissident groups.Indigenous assassinations in CaucaSource: United NationsThe cocaine boomLess than two months after the FARC began demobilizing in January 2017, dissident members of the FARC’s former 5th Front rearmed in the southwestern Cauca province and others joined a rival group, the EPL.By the end of 2019, more than 10 dissident FARC factions were vying for control over the Nasa people’s reserves in northern Cauca, according to conflict monitoring NGO Indepaz.Furthermore, there are indications that Mexican cartels have been incentivizing the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, in the region around the Nasa people’s reservesCoca cultivation in Colombia’s Pacific regionSource: United Nations Office on Drugs and CrimeWhy the Nasa’s reserves attract narcosThe United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have additionally warned that the coca that is being grown has been genetically modified and the cocaine factories in the region optimized.This has allowed the governments of the United States and Colombia to claim that the number of hectares used for coca cultivation has gone down while potential cocaine production is up, particularly in northern Cauca.The indigenous, however, are finding themselves in increased danger because the narco-guerrillas want to use their reserves to move cocaine to the Naya River, a major drug trafficking route, and the Pacific Ocean.Colombia’s potential cocaine productionSource: UNODCThe peace process’ solutionsThe Nasa people reject drug trafficking and want Duque to implement the peace process because the counternarcotics element of it could reduce drug trafficking in their region through crop substitution and regional development.The agreement would also increase protection for indigenous leaders who have been a prime target for the narco-guerrillas in an attempt to break the Nasa people’s resistanceIllegal armed groups threatening the NASA peopleAGCAguilas NegrasEPLJaime Ramirez FrontDagoberto Ramos FrontCarlos Patiño FrontJacobo Arenas Mobile ColumnUnited Pacific Guerrillas Caucadrug traffickingFARC dissidentsindigenous issuesMinga ",https://colombiareports.com/minga-part-2-colombias-indigenous-vs-narco-guerrillas/,MINGA! | Part 2: Colombia’s indigenous vs narco-guerrillas
" Dissident cells of the demobilized EPL guerrilla group have been popping up throughout Colombia after not leaving their stronghold along the border with Venezuela for decades.The narco-guerrillas, called “Los Pelusos” by the government, were believed to be doomed after the security forces killed long-time leader “Megateo” in 2015.After the dissidents of the group that demobilized in 1990 also got involved in a turf war with ELN guerrillas over control in their stronghold in the northeastern Catatumbo region in 2017, few believed the EPL would survive.Alleged merger with ‘Los Rastrojos’The security forces believe the EPL merged with drug trafficking group “Los Rastrojos,” which allowed them to repel ELN attacks and remain in control around Cucuta, Colombia’s largest city on the Venezuelan border.Following the alleged merger, the EPL has popped up in several key drug trafficking regions throughout the country, according to independent conflict monitoring NGO Indepaz.Whether their appearance is part of a strategy to branch out or the consequence of their displacement from Catatumbo is uncertain.The group’s first appearance outside Catatumbo was in the southwestern Cauca province almost immediately after the FARC’s demobilization in January 2017.While at odds with rearmed FARC guerrillas and the ELN, the EPL appears to have consolidated control around the Naya River, an important drug trafficking route to the Pacific Ocean.Far from consolidationThe group also appeared along the border with Ecuador and in the northern Cordoba province last year. Whether they will be able to settle in these regions is hardly certain however.“La Mafia” appears to have the southern Putumayo province under control and paramilitary group AGC wouldn’t be welcoming the EPL with open arms in Cordoba.The narco-guerrillas and the Rastrojos together are believed to have approximately 300 men in arms, which would make it difficult to challenge established groups like the AGC and La Mafia, who know their strongholds inside out.Another risk factor for the group is its internal stability. The EPL may have more than twice the men than the Rastrojos, but the narcos allegedly have an undisputed leader, “Becerro,” while the command over the EPL is uncertain after the death of its leader “Pacora” in September last year. drug traffickingEPL ",https://colombiareports.com/the-return-of-colombias-epl-guerrillas/,Are Colombia’s EPL guerrillas making a comeback?

" Colombia’s increasingly authoritarian president Ivan Duque is facing his fifth criminal charge, this time for allegedly trying to pin a 1995 assassination on one of his predecessors.Duque and his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa and former mafia attorney Diego Cadena have all been charged by former intelligence chief Ramiro Bejerano.Alvaro Uribe, Ivan Duque, Diego Cadena and Francisco BarbosaReal conspiracy chargesAccording to Bejerano, Duque’s patron and allies were conspiring to fabricate criminal charges against former President Ernesto Samper, Bejerano’s former boss, for the 1995 assassination of former presidential candidate Alvaro Gomez.The Supreme Court found that the former president and the mafia lawyer in 2008 were seeking benefits for extradited drug traffickers who could support a conspiracy theory claiming Samper (Liberal Party) was behind the assassination of late his conservative rival.At the same time, Cadena was seeking allegedly false testimonies to defend Uribe and his brother Santiago, who are being investigated for allegedly co-founding far-right death squads in the 1990’s.Uribe and Cadena were caught, however, and are currently facing fraud and bribery charges.Colombia’s ex-president lobbied US leniency for narcos to help brotherDuque learns guerrillas kill peopleAlvaro GomezColombia’s war crimes tribunal started an investigation last week after demobilized FARC guerrillas claimed responsibility for the brutal killing of the legendary Conservative Party politician.Duque surprisingly rejected the former guerrillas’ admitted war crime on Wednesday, claiming that “we shouldn’t rule out other hypotheses.”The president went as far as claiming that falsely taking responsibility for a crime would also be criminal, implying the burden of proof of crimes the FARC confess to lies with the demobilized guerrillas.When Duque swore in Barbosa as Prosecutor General, in February, the president explicitly asked his high-school friend to solve the murder.The prosecution, however, appeared to not even have considered the demobilized leftist guerrilla group as a suspect in the murder of the right-wing icon.Instead, prosecution sources told news website La Nueva Prensa that Barbosa was hoping to announce progress in criminal investigations against Samper on November 2, exactly 25 years after Gomez’s violent death.“They should be looking up everything I said about Alvaro Gomez”The president seemed unable to fathom the FARC would admit to exactly the crime his political patron was using to divert attention away from his apparent criminal activity.Uribe seemed unable to fathom that not journalists, but colluding with the mafia to obstruct justice does harm, especially when you’re the suspect in a criminal investigation.AU: Let me tell you something, you must avoid those journalists, they do us enormous harm. They are after a scandal, let’s not give them one, we’ll lose our effectiveness.DC: President, I have always handled a low profile, but this was leaked by that journalist.AU: Tell them to ask Jaime Lombana, that Jaime sent that letter to the Court, tell them to ask Jaime.DC: Okay, so I will cut ties with the lady. What I don’t want, president, is that this is a free vocation I don’t have.AU: They’ll immediately come with: “Uribe, through the mafia, seeks to dismantle testimony against him,” that’s what they’ll come out with.CD: Of course, president, and it’s not worse if I stay quiet?AU: Tell her.

" Colombia’s Foreign Ministry confirmed claims made by Colombia Reports last week that freelance journalists have been stripped of the possibility to apply for a migrant visa.In a statement, the Foreign Ministry also confirmed that it continues to demand journalism degrees from foreign journalists, which is unconstitutional, according to press freedom foundation FLIP.Unlike for example oncologists, who need a degree in oncology to work, journalism falls under the category of “free professions” that requires no diploma in the field, according to Colombia’s constitution.This implies that journalists who studied Latin American Studies or Economy, for example, would not be able to stay in the country for more than two years.Only journalists with a work contract would be allowed a migrant visa that would allow them to stay long, but ignores the fact that the majority of journalists and foreign correspondents work on a freelance bases.Colombia blocking journalist visas in ongoing assault on press freedomNevertheless, the Foreign Ministry claimed that “it respects freedom of expression and information and recognizes the fundamental role of journalists and the media in democracy. Colombia is a country open to the presence of journalists of all nationalities who can fully carry out their work in the national territory.”The Foreign Ministry did not respond to Colombia Reports’ claim about the apparent arbitrary use of its discretionary faculty, which allows governments to block foreigners, for example if they are on a terror list or suspected of criminal activity.FLIP director Jonathan Bock told W Radio on Friday that his organization has had trouble for years getting concrete answers about these apparently arbitrary decisions to either refuse to grant a journalist visa.Bock told Colombia Reports last week it currently has nine reports of journalists with visa issues. This website talked to another three who were unable to return to the country where they have worked for years.Following a 2018 report by this website and The Bogota Post, both Colombia Reports and the FLIP have been monitoring the situation which, with the unannounced new restrictions, dramatically restricts journalists’ ability to work.How Colombia is preventing you from knowing the truth about the countryWhile some journalists wouldn’t need more than a two-year visa, journalists who have regular assignment with foreign media would be forced to leave the country without being able to make contacts or scratch the surface of the country, its society and its cultures. freedom of pressjournalism ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-confirms-blocking-visas-for-freelance-journalists/,Colombia confirms blocking visas for foreign journalists
" Colombia’s last-standing guerrilla group, the ELN, reiterated their request for a bilateral ceasefire on Saturday after conflict monitors registered an intensification of attacks.In an open letter to the governments of Colombia and the United States, the ELN again asked for a “bilateral and temporary ceasefire… as has been urged by the UN Secretary General, Pope Francis and the UN Security Council, in order to better carry out the humanitarian work required to confront Covid-19.”Far-right president Ivan Duque rejected the UN Security Council’s demand for a global ceasefire in July, claiming that “our government will never abandon its constitutional duty to confront crime in the entire territory of Colombia. The ELN is a terrorist group that has scourged the country with barbarism for decades.”A 200-year history lesson on the ELN’s war with Colombia’s stateWashington DC and Bogota DC recently stepped up claims the ELN is involved in drug trafficking while the guerrillas claim they are a political organization.In their letter, the ELN proposed to create an “international commission to verify on the ground if the ELN has crops, laboratories, infrastructure or routes for drug trafficking, or if it has businesses with chemical precursors used in the production of cocaine.”The ELN declared a unilateral ceasefire in April and said it would maintain a defensive stance in May, but stepped up attack from six in August to 11 last month, according to independent conflict monitor CERAC.This is still considerably less than the 30 attacks registered by CERAC in February.Duque suspended peace talks with the ELN when he took office in August 2018, but has been unable to prevent the guerrillas’ territorial expansion that followed since then.Why peace talks with Colombia’s ELN rebels are so difficultThe guerrillas’ strongholds are in regions that have historically suffered state neglect. The ELN additionally has tried to strengthen its National Urban War Front, which has been active in Colombia’s cities since 1986.Duque has been explicit about his disinterest in bartering peace with the guerrillas that carried out their first attack in 1964.Most conflict analysts have been skeptical about the sincerity of the ELN’s expressed desire to make peace and believe the guerrillas seek to increase their leverage for eventual peace negotiations. armed conflictceasefireELNpeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-eln-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-after-intensifying-guerrilla-attacks/,Colombia’s ELN guerrillas reiterate call for ceasefire after intensifying attacks
" Colombia’s defense minister on Wednesday apologized for the violent crackdown of peaceful protests in November last year after a Bogota court gave him 24 hours to comply with a Supreme Court order.Controversial Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo apologized for the police brutality in Congress where he was called to appear over a motion of no confidence filed by the opposition.While defending his 10 months in office, the minister asked forgiveness for the “acts committed by the mobile anti-riot squads of the National Police, during the protests going on in the country after November 21, 2019” as ordered by the Supreme Court last month.Trujillo initially said he had already complied with the court order before it was issued, claiming that an apology for police brutality committed on September 9 “referred to any violation of the law anytime.”Colombia’s defense minister defies logic itself over police brutalityHuman rights organizations sued the minister, claiming he was in contempt of court, after which the Bogota Superior Tribunal ordered the minister to comply with the Supreme Court order within 24 hours.Within one day from the notification of this order, comply strictly with the order that in the words of the Court is due as a symbolic reparation measure.Bogota Superior TribunalThe minister survived the motion of no confidence as it failed to received the support from center right parties, despite fierce criticism from the leftist opposition, which accused the increasingly authoritarian government of President Ivan Duque of shifting towards dictatorial rule.Many consider that we are on an authoritarian drift; a civil dictatorship that does not require the noise of sabers, which little by little has weakened the separation of powers.House Representative Angela Maria RobledoTrujillo said that “this is not true.

" A Bogota court revoked the house arrest of Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe after the Supreme Court referred his alleged witness tampering case to the ordinary justice system.According to the judge ruling over Uribe’s indictment, the Supreme Court’s decision to refer the far-right politician’s case to a lower court effectively removed the legal basis for his detention.The Supreme Court tried Uribe under criminal proceedings specific for privileged crime suspects because Uribe was senator when the high court opened an investigation into his alleged bribing of witnesses to file fraudulent charges against a political opponent in 2018.The Bogota judge ruled that Uribe’s resignation from the senate and the Supreme Court’s decision to refer his case to a lower court made any Supreme Court decision in its proceedings null and void.In regards to the former president’s house arrest, this means that an ordinary court would have to place Uribe under house arrest, which the indictment judge decided against.The decision is a major victory for Uribe who can now defend himself in liberty against charges filed by the prosecution where the former president wields considerably more power than in the Supreme Court.Until his premature exit from politics last year, Uribe’s future became increasingly bleak after the Supreme Court’ decision to investigate him not just for his alleged witness tampering, but also election fraud, and complicity in three massacres and a homicide.Of these investigations, only the election fraud case remained under the jurisdiction of the the Supreme Court because of evidence Uribe’s senatorial aides were involved, the top court ruled last month.The former president’s response to the ruling was short. “Thank God,” Uribe said on Twitter.The victim of the far-right politician’s alleged fraud and bribery practices, opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, said he disagreed with the ruling, but that this “does not change my intimate conviction of respect for justice and compliance with its decisions.While the decision is a major legal win for Uribe, the piling criminal investigations did end his formal political career as the former president’s resignation from the senate is irrevocable.

" Colombia’s Supreme Court confirmed that military intelligence was fabricating ties between opposition Senator Gustavo Bolivar and guerrilla group ELN.Bolivar, a former script writer, was one of at least 130 politician, journalists and even a former Colombia Reports intern who were profiled by the military.Colombia gathered intel on ‘more than 200’ politicians, journalists and human rights defendersFrom screenwriter to military targetIndignant, the opposition senator found that the military intelligence document “referred to his relations with ‘indigenous movements, indigenous leaders and some illegal groups like the ELN.”The outspoken senator filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights against what he called President Ivan Duque’s “asshole government” on Twitter and a “dictatorship” before the inter-american human rights council.“I have worked since I was 12 years old and have never lifted a finger against a living being,” said Bolivar on Twitter.I am a businessman, I ended up campaigning for the Senate, and one of the things those who profiled me say is that I have links with the ELN group.Senator Gustavo BolivarThe opposition senator, or “Special Case #1″ as the army called him,” had requested the Supreme Court provided him the portion of the National Army’s “secret files” that were made after Duque appointed retired General Nicasio Martinez as army commander in December 2018.Paranoid Colombia: even Duque’s former chief of staff target of military spyingGustavo BolivarGustavo BolivarBefore being elected to the Senate, Guatavo Bolivar was a writer, journalist and screenwriter, who became famous for writing the hit series “Sin Senos No Hay Paraoiso.”The son of a pharmacist studied Social Communication before becoming a journalist and a writer and ultimately one of the most successful screenwriters in Colombia.Bolivar entered politics in 2018 as Petro’s right-hand-man and has since received death threats from far-right group “Aguilas Negras,” which is believed to be linked to the security forces.Goodbye generalMartinez resigned a year later after the Supreme Court found that the National Army’s intelligence unit was illegally wiretapping civilians seemed inconvenient, weekly Semana reported in January.Months later, the same magazine reported that the army only had been profiling civilians, from former journalists to the president’s former chief of staff.The army considering civilians intelligence targets forced Duque to purge the military leadership he initially appointed in late 2018.A number of the top military officials who were fired were allegedly involved in corruption and criminal activity.One of them, former 4th Brigade commander General Jorge Romero was even suspected of arms trafficking for organized crime groups in Medellin, according to Semana.The National Army came under fire almost immediately after Martinez’s appointment and the New York Times reported that the new army commander was demanding minimum numbers of combat kills and captures other commanders feared would lead to the killing and arresting of innocent civilians. army wiretapping scandalgustavo Bolivarmilitary ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-criminalization-of-dissent-senator-gustavo-bolivar/,Colombia’s criminalization of dissent: Senator Gustavo Bolivar
" Colombia’s Supreme Court ruled that a lower court may decide to revoke former President Alvaro Uribe’s house arrest and start the fraud and bribery trial from scratch.Two and a half years after the Supreme Court began investigating the far-right politician for allegedly tampering witnesses, the court upheld Uribe’s house arrest but allowed a Bogota court to revoke this.The Supreme Court also said that Uribe’s resignation from the Senate made it was “unviable” to continue the prosecution of Uribe following the criminal proceedings for “privileged” suspects.This could be good news for Uribe because it allows the prosecution to discard evidence gathered by the Supreme Court of Uribe’s alleged involvement in the bribery of witnesses to file fraudulent criminal charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda.Uribe resigned from the Senate in August after the Supreme Court placed him under house arrest, indicating the high court believed to have enough evidence for a conviction.Unlike at the high court, the former president has significant influence over Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, who appointed questionable prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes to prosecute the political patron of President Ivan Duque.Jaimes has indicated he wants to start the trial from scratch, which would nullify the criminal charges, but this decision lies with the Bogota judge deciding on the proceedings.Cepeda, whose attorney had asked not to change criminal proceedings, said he respected the court decision and “was ready for a new debate” over the former president’s alleged guilt in filing false charges against the leftist senator.In a parallel case, Uribe’s former fixer is also being prosecuted for his role in the alleged bribing of witnesses who testified against Cepeda after the former president filed the bogus criminal charges in 2014.Uribe falsely accused the senator of using false witnesses after the release of the testimonies of former paramilitary fighters who claimed the former president and his brother, Santiago Uribe, formed a death squad in the late 1990’s.

" Colombia’s prosecution’s attempt to revoke the house arrest of former president Alvaro Uribe may be blocked by the Supreme Court, weekly Semana reported Sunday.According to the weekly, Supreme Court magistrate Gerson Chaverra advised his colleagues to deny the prosecution’s request to revoke Uribe’s house arrest and start the far-right politician’s fraud and bribery trial from scratch.The advice is a major setback for Uribe, who resigned from the Senate in August in the hope that waiving his congressional privilege would compel the Supreme Court to transfer his witness tampering trial to a lower court.The Supreme Court agreed, but the Bogota judge who was put in charge of the case referred the request of controversial prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes to reset the investigation that began in 2018 and release Uribe back to the high court.Prosecutor trying Colombia’s former president facing his own criminal investigationThe prosecution’s attempts to help UribeGabriel JaimesJaimes sought to revoke the criminal charges and the decision to place the former president under house arrest by applying the criminal proceedings of Law 906 of 2004 that applies to ordinary crime suspects instead of Law 600 of 2000 that applies to alleged criminals enjoying congressional privileges.Chevarra advised the plenary chamber of the Supreme Court to allow the Bogota court to proceed using the criminal procedures of Law 906, but argued this does not allow the prosecutor to revoke the criminal charges filed against Uribe or the former president’s house arrest.Consequently, under the guidelines of Law 906 of 2004, the process must continue, advancing the procedural phases that in accordance with the aforementioned criminal code follow after the formulated criminal charges.Supreme Court magistrate Gerson ChaverraUribe’s alleged victim pushes backSenator Ivan Cepeda (Image: Senate)The defense attorney of the victim of Uribe’s alleged criminal practices, opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, argued that “the procedural harmony of the case must be maintained” by proceeding with the trial using the criminal code used since the court opened an investigation against Uribe in February 2018.According to Semana, the magistrate advised the Supreme Court to proceed under common criminal proceedings, but bar Jaimes from undoing the Supreme Court’s advances made during the historic investigation.This would mean that the prosecutor will be unable to discard evidence gathered by the Supreme Court or request Uribe’s release.The leader of the far-right Democratic Center and patron of President Ivan Duque got himself in a legal fix after filing bogus witness tampering changes against Cepeda in 2014 after the opposition Senator published testimonies of former paramilitaries testifying Uribe and his brother Santiago co-founded a paramilitary death squad in the 1990s’s.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonPride comes before the fallFormer President Alvaro Uribe (Image: Democratic Center)After investigating these charges, the Supreme Court said that it had evidence indicated that the former president had been bribing witnesses to file fraudulent charges against Cepeda.Uribe’s alleged ties of the “Bloque Metro” that left approximately 4,000 victims in Medellin and the surrounding Antioquia province collapsed his party’s support in the 2019 local elections and ended the former president’s political career.Why Colombia’s former president is accused of forming bloodthirsty death squadsSubsequent evidence that Uribe’s party aligned with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 elections to favor Duque further sunk public support and also got the president and the ruling party in legal trouble.

" Demobilized FARC leaders took responsibility for the 1995 assassination of the conservative former presidential candidate Alvaro Gomez and five other political killings on Saturday.In a press release, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) said that the former guerrillas admitted being responsible for assassinating Gomez, a former peace negotiator, two former dissidents, a former army general and a far-right politician.None of the high-profile killings committed between 1987 and 2002 were ever solved. In cases like that of the late Conservative Party leader, the prosecution never considered the FARC a suspect.The surprise confessionThe FARC leaders’ surprise confession of the murder of Gomez was rejected by President Ivan Duque and the Gomez family, whose family lawyer claimed the former guerrillas sought to frustrate the investigation led by Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa.Duque asked Barbosa to prioritize the murder of the legendary politician during the chief prosecutor’s inauguration earlier this year.Following the FARC leaders’ confession, the JEP will begin a parallel investigation into the veracity of the former guerrillas’ claim while the prosecution will continue investigating previous theses that implicated, among others, former President Ernesto Samper.The other murdersHernando Pizarro (1995)Hernando PizarroHernando Pizarro was the brother of late M-19 guerrilla leader Carlos Pizarro and the second-in-command of the FARC dissident group “Ricardo Franco Comando” that was active in the southwestern Cauca province.As commander of this guerrilla unit, Pizarro carried out the Tacueyo Massacre between November 1985 and January 1986 in which the guerrillas executed 164 people they accused of being traitors.The massacre led to the unit’s expulsion from the so-called National Guerrilla Coordination of the M-19 and indigenous guerrilla group Quintin Lame they had joined. after abandoning the FARCPizarro was assassinated by men dressed up as prosecution officials after resisting the fake arrest.“Javier Delgado” (2002)“Javier Delgado”Jose Fedor Rey, a.k.a. “Javier Delgado,” founded the “Ricardo Franco Comando” after abandoning the FARC in 1985.Delgado’s extreme cruelty and his leading role in the Tacueyo Massacre earned him the nickname “the Monster of the Andes,” which saw his group rejected by all other guerrilla groups.The guerrilla leader was arrested in 1995 and sentenced to 17 years in prison for the massacre.Delgado was found hanged in his cell in the Palmira prison on June 30, 2002.

" The family of late presidential candidate Alvaro Gomez rejected FARC leaders’ confession they were behind the 1995 assassination of one of Colombia’s most legendary politicians.Almost 25 years after the assassination, FARC leaders said they were responsible for the murder they were never suspected of.Gomez’ nephew Enrique, who is the family’s attorney, fiercely criticized the former guerrilla leaders’ surprise confession, claiming they were “washing the hands of [former president] Ernesto Samper,” who has been mentioned as one of the suspects.The Gomez family has heard multiple hypotheses over the past 25 years, but never one that involved the FARC, whose leaders provided no evidence to corroborate their self-proclaimed responsibility.Additionally, Enrique Gomez couldn’t hide his frustration that the 2016 peace deal exempts the FARC from serving time in prison unlike the suspects mentioned in 25 years of fruitless criminal investigations.The assassinationGomez was assassinated around 10:30AM on November 2, 1995, after leaving the elite Sergio Arboleda university he had co-founded and where he had just finished giving a class in political history.Eye witnesses said that one of the two hitmen dressed in black and armed with machine guns opened fire on Gomez’s car as it was leaving the university parking lot while the second one was shooting in the air, presumably to generate the panic.The two assassins had been hanging around the university for at least half an hour and fled on a motorcycle after riddling Gomez’s car with bullets, the eye witnesses said.The conservative leader’s driver survived the attack and drove his fatally injured boss and bodyguard to the nearby El Country hospital where both men died of their injuries shortly after their arrival.Hours after the attack, police claimed to have arrested one of the assassins, a 25-year-old man who was allegedly carrying a revolver. Because eye witnesses were explicit the assassins used machine guns the suspect was ultimately released.Theory 1: army involvement in assassinationRetired General Rito Alejo del RioThe military became the first real suspect of the assassination days after Gomez’s death after press reported that the Jeep of General Eduardo Cifuentes, the director of the military academy, had been driving around in the neighborhood around the time of the attack.The prosecution charged the former commander of the National Army’s 10th Brigade, retired colonel Bernardo Ruiz, with the murder in 1999, claiming the military decided to assassinate him because he refused to take part in a ploy to oust Samper.Ruiz was absolved, but the theory was shared by former US ambassador Myles Frechette, who said in 2015 that “personally, I believe some people on the right and possibly members of the military did it.”At one moment, many distinguished members of Colombian society and Colombian politics came to my home to tell me “look, what would be the United States’ position if there were to be a coup here?” “Don’t even joke about it, no way,” I said, “that is the past and no longer part of our foreign policy” and they said “and you don’t want to ask Washington?’ and I said “I don’t have to ask Washington, enough.”Former US ambassador Myles FrechetteFormer chief prosecutor Eduardo Montealegre subsequently said that a demobilized member of paramilitary organization AUC confirmed that imprisoned army general Rito Alejo del Rio had met with paramilitary associates to plan multiple assassinations, including that of Gomez.Montealegre’s successor, former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez, opened criminal investigations against three top police officials in 2018 for allegedly trying to frustrate the investigation in the aftermath of the murder.Theory 2: Samper ordered assassination of criticHoracio Serpa and Ernesto SamperThe Gomez family has been more inclined to believe that Samper and former Senator Horacio Serpa ordered the assassination over the conservative politician’s claim they knew that Samper’s 1994 election was financed by the Cali Cartel.This theory was first coined by extradited drug lord Luis Hernando Gomez, a.k.a. “Rasguño,” who claimed in 2010 that the Liberal Party politicians had teamed up with narcos to get rid of Gomez.According to Rasguño, he overheard former Norte del Valle Cartel bosses Orlando Henao and “Don Efra,” and the late founder of paramilitary organization AUC, Carlos Castaño, fight over the murder in early 1996, months after the assassination.Carlos told them that they had no reason to kill Alvaro Gomez and less to protect a bandit like Samper, that Samper was a bandit just like Serpa and that he knew that he hadn’t killed Serpa because Serpa was a friend of ours, but that Serpa was a total guerrilla.“Rasguño”Rasguño additionally claimed that Henao told him that “Gomez was preparing a coup with the military and the Bogota elite,” to oust Samper, so the Norte del Valle cartel boss, “‘El Gordo’ and Horacio ordered” to kill the Conservative Party mogul.The narco’s claims were rejected over inconsistencies and a lack of evidence.In September, however, the Gomez family said that evidence that Samper ordered national intelligence chief Ramiro Bejarano to illegally profile his rival.“This confirms what Bejarano and Samper have always denied, which is that Alvaro Gomez was being shadowed by the [now-defunct intelligence agency] DAS, days before his death; as Fernando Botero stated at the time,” the family lawyer said.Theory 3: The FARC killed ‘military objective’FARC director Rodrigo LondoñoAccording to the FARC, their former guerrilla group assassinated Gomez because the Conservative Party mogul “was considered a military objective and a class enemy who represented those who declared war on the recently born FARC-EP” in 1964.While the FARC leaders provided a motive, the former guerrilla commanders provided no evidence or specifics that would support their claim.We recognize that it was a mistake to have assassinated a politician of the stature of Alvaro Gomez. We have read his biographies and today we know that his contribution to the peace of the country would have been fundamental. But war clouds the vision of the future and only allow to see reality in black and white to divide it into friends and enemies.FARCMost painfully, the former guerrilla leaders asked forgiveness to the Gomez family while destroying the victims’ hypothesis that Samper was involved.Instead of providing closure to their alleged victims, the former FARC commanders ripped open the wounds of the Gomez family, who pointed out that the former guerrillas undermined ongoing prosecution investigations while enjoying immunity as part of a 2016 peace deal.

" Civilians in northern Colombia are keeping their eyes open and their mouth shut after AGC paramilitaries embarked on a surprise territorial offensive against guerrillas and police.On Thursday, citizens in more than 60 municipalities woke up with AGC graffiti’s announcing their presence while presumed members of the group dispersed pamphlets.AGC turn on guerrillas and policeIn Medellin, pamphlets of the paramilitary group of “Otoniel” appeared on Friday, announcing they would be imposing order, and take acting against police brutality and “attacks from ELN and dissident FARC guerrillas” who have been accused of infiltrating recent anti-government protests.The AGC’s expressed support for peaceful protests is a break from the past when the paramilitaries’ predecessors of the AUC also considered any opposition to the government of former President Alvaro Uribe “subversive.”Otoniel’s dissident group, however, has been openly critical of President Ivan Duque, claiming they were betrayed by the Uribe during the AUC’s demobilization between 2003 and 2006, and want to take part in the peace process carried out with the FARC.We respect legitimate social protest which is caused by the indiscriminate abuses of the public force as part of a systematic and sinister policy from way back that implied not just arbitrary detentions, and all types of physical and psychological violence, but has come to the execution of the death sentence by snipers targeting any kind of Colombian.Autodefensas Gaitanistas de ColombiaThe surprise offensive, the AGC’s show of force presumably seeks to intimidate the police and people the paramilitaries consider guerrillas alike.Back to square oneNational Army commander General Eduardo Zapateiro called on citizens to “keep informing us,” contrary to a local from the rural Montes de Maria region in the Caribbean who told local newspaper El Heraldo that the local rule is to “keep your eyes open and your mouth shut” if you want to live.The locals from Montes de Maria learned to live with notoriously brutal paramilitary groups in the 1990’s already and presume the return to the AGC’s rule is no different that that of their predecessors, the AUC.The communities begin to behave as they did during the time of terror: we have to open our eyes and close our mouths.Local from Montes de MariaGeneral Juan Carlos Ramirez, whose 7th National Army Division has been repeatedly accused of colluding with the drug trafficking paramilitaries, confirmed the locals’ claim that “these criminals are trying to terrorize the population,” adding that 47 members of the AGC have surrendered so far this year.Multiple independent conflict monitoring NGO’s concur that the AGC, which also has ties to the private sector and Colombia’s political elite, is Colombia’s largest illegal armed group and expanding.Like their predecessors of the AUC, the AGC is accused of the vast majority of human rights violations and the intimidation of community leaders and human rights defenders.President Ivan Duque, whose far-right Democratic Center party has been associated with paramilitary violence, did not respond to the latest AGC offensive.

" The military doctrine a Medellin court dubbed the “origin of evil” in Colombia contains the concept of “the internal enemy,” which originally referred to American slaves.The National Security Doctrine didn’t exist until 1947 and wasn’t introduced in Colombia until 1962.The concept of the internal enemy, however, dates back as far as 1814 when Thomas Jefferson expressed his concern about the perceived threat of the British Empire igniting a slave revolt during the War of 1812.Yet the hour of emancipation is advancing, in the march of time. It will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our own minds; or by the bloody process of St. Domingo, excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy, if once stationed permanently within our Country, and offering asylum and arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not left turned over.Thomas Jefferson“The association of the enemy with emancipation reinforced white Virginians’ perception that the defense of slavery was fundamental to a worthwhile American union,” which laid the foundation of the American Civil War, according to US history professor Carter Bruns.This association may also have led to the violent repression of the Civil Rights movement in America in the 1960’s.How a US military doctrine became Colombia’s ‘origin of evil’ | Part 1: “Popeye”From slaves to communistsIn Colombia, the US military introduced the “internal enemy” concept as part of the National Security Doctrine in 1962 and promoted the violent crackdown of opposition to the authoritarian National Front.One of the military attacks that sought to do this led to the formation of the FARC guerrilla group in 1964.Jefferson’s concern of the British achieving victory through the armed support of enslaved African Americans was similar to John F. Kennedy’s concern of the Soviet Union winning the Cold War by “offering asylum and arms to the oppressed” in the Americas, especially after the Cuban Revolution of 1958.Moscow was never interested in South America, but Colombia’s governments had been more than interested in exploiting the “Red Scare” for their own benefit as early as 1948.When the murder of Liberal Party leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan in April that year ignited extreme violence between liberals and conservatives, US Department of State George Marshall believed the conspiracy theory of his Colombian counterpart, Laureano Gomez, that the revolt was a communist coup.Marshall and other delegates to the Inter-American Conference have now likewise accused Soviet Russia, and its tool, international communism, of instigating the riots that wrecked Bogota and cast a pall over the whole Western Hemisphere.New York TimesThe CIA’s first director, Admiral Hillenkoetter, almost lost his job and President Harry Truman almost lost the 1948 elections because of Gomez’s lie, who started a trend that continues until this day.How a US military doctrine became Colombia’s ‘origin of evil’ | Part 2: Special warfareFrom communists to young peoplePresident Ivan Duque’s claims that Venezuela was infiltrating anti-government protests in November last year, for example, was also entirely fabricated, and recreated the concept of an external enemy, Venezuela, that allegedly sought to overthrow his government by infiltrating the protests, making the participants the internal enemy.While the protesters had no intention of overthrowing the government, Duque closed the Venezuelan border, went into siege mode and violently cracked down on the protests.Dozens of Venezuelan migrants were deported on trumped up charges they had instigated vandalism during the largely peaceful protests.Like his legendary predecessor, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believed the Bogota hoax and expressed his support for Duque’s violent crackdown of peaceful protests.We in the Trump administration will continue to support countries trying to prevent Cuba and Venezuela from hijacking those protests and we’ll work with legitimate (governments) to prevent protests from morphing into riots and violence that don’t reflect the democratic will of the people.US Secretary of State Mike PompeoColombia’s Supreme Court knew better and ordered Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo last week to apologize for the police brutality and guarantee citizens’ right to protest.A nation that seeks to recover and build its democratic identity cannot describe the citizenry that legitimately protests using the rhetoric of friend and foe, left and right, good and bad, friends of peace and enemies of peace, but as the political expression that seeks to open space for dialogue, consensus and the non-violent reconstruction of the Constitutional State of Law.Supreme CourtFurthermore, the court ruled the government may no longer stigmatize protesters, or associate peaceful protests with the hostile activity of a military threat.From the National Security Doctrine to the Damasco DoctrineThe military introduced the new Damasco Doctrine earlier this year to explicitly do away with the concept of the “internal enemy” that had justified the killing of any government critic a military target since the introduction of the National Security Doctrine in the 1960’s.Doctrinal reform should not aim solely at the counterinsurgency war, since this has been the raw material for the majority of international sentences against Colombia and numerous reports by non-governmental organizations that point out that it is precisely the doctrine – based on the internal enemy, anti-communism, and the National Security Doctrine in the context of the Cold War – that is the framework through which the Colombian Armed Forces, especially the Army, allegedly committed the greatest crimes against humanity on the continent.Colonel Pedro Javier GuevaraThe administration of far-right President Ivan Duque, however, continues to use the “internal enemy” concept to violently repress opposition, Bogota social leader Henry Gomez told student newspaper 070 on Monday.According to Gomez, the government is “resorting to that same ghost that we saw during the time of [former President] Alvaro Uribe: an internal enemy,” which laid the foundation for the American Civil War in the early 19th Century and is threatening Colombia’s peace process today, according to Gomez.One of the points of the agreement was to be able to engage in political opposition without fear of being threatened, disappeared, raped or killed, but that is not what we are seeing.Bogota social leader Henry GomezAccording to the student newspaper, social leaders throughout Bogota have been receiving death threats from the “Aguilas Negras” after renewed protests earlier this month. armed conflictNational Security Doctrinepeace processsocial

" Diana Rojas doesn’t care if the paramilitaries kill her. The government of Colombia’s far-right President Ivan Duque killed two of her three children, according to the single mother.Rojas is from La Fortaleza, a slum between the city of Cucuta and the Venezuelan border that is home to some 1,000 families.In this neighborhood alone, 15 children have died of starvation in the past six months, resident Manny Blackberry told Colombia Reports on Sunday.“Including mine, there’s like 15 or 16,” the single mother confirmed from the hospital where she was trying to save her last surviving son.What starving to death is likeEven before former Senator Susana Correa of Duque’s Democratic Center party became the director of the Social Prosperity Department (DPS), the monthly $42 stipend was not enough to survive the coronavirus crisis, according to Blackberry.The 37-year-old engineer lost his job in March and has been making an extra $9 a month filling potholes and charging voluntary contributions for two days a week.Still, “we eat once a day, in the afternoon so we don’t go to bed hungry,” Blackberry told Colombia Reports.The engineer’s three children are alive, but the food shortage did not just kill Rojas’ two youngest sons, he said.In the same family, that of Diana, four of her cousins and nephews died, so that’s six…. Four died in another family and on the lower plain — because we live way up the hill — five died, so that’s 15 I’m aware of. My mom is among the elderly of whom another four or five died. Manny BlackberryImage: Manny BlackberryCoronavirus stipends disappearingThe so-called “Ingreso Solidario” program never provided enough to feed a family, but payments have been disappearing after Duque made his party member director of the DSP.Correa was meant to “help improve the targeting of social programs for the vulnerable population,” the president tweeted in late June, but “they’re ripping us off,” the engineer said.“The first three months were fine,” according to the single mother, but since the former senator took office payments have gone missing, according to the residents of La Esperanza.I go the bank and they tell me that I have already cashed it, and DPS says that it is the platform.Manny BlackberryWhile DPS is blaming bank Davivienda for the newly arisen problems, bank clerks have said Correa is “ripping off the people, they say so themselves,” according to Rojas.Colombia Reports emailed the former senator on Friday after finding Correa received complaints from throughout the country, but received no reply.“They’re making fun of us because we’re poor,” the single mother from La Esperanza said.Image: Manny BlackberrySelling your body and still lose your kidsThe irregular payments forced Rojas to sell her body on the streets of Cucuta to try to feed her children, the single mother said.She is hardly the only one from La Esperanza to resort to prostitution, according to Blackberry. “Women older than 16 here have to sell their bodies in order to help out at home.”The former engineer’s wife is not one of them. “I got a warrior,” he said.We have struggled, suffered hunger and we cry, and if there is only for the children we endure, but she doesn’t do it or considers doing so as she says it is shameful.Manny BlackberryHis neighbor said she would probably hit the streets again if she was able to leave the hospital where her only surviving son was being treated for undernourishment.Image: Manny BlackberryStarving in narco landColombia Reports was only able to speak to the residents of La Esperanza over the phone and without the knowledge of their neighbors. The paramilitaries don’t tolerate outsiders.“I went there once and they pulled their guns on me,” a psychologist from Cucuta who wished to remain anonymous told Colombia Reports on Sunday. “That was like three years ago.”“Los Rastrojos” continue to impose their rule with an iron fist, especially now ELN guerrillas are trying to take control over important smuggling routes.“They work like the militias [on the Venezuelan side of the border] and change guards every 15 to 29 days so that nobody become familiar and loses respect,” said Blackberry.Image: Manny Blackberry“It’s because of them I lost my children”When asked when Rojas saw the police last, she laughed. “Those guys don’t come here,” the single mother said.Because Colombia reports has the obligation to protect its sources, the residents of La Fortaleza agreed to use false names although Rojas said “I’m not afraid,” least of all of the government.“It’s because of them I lost my children,” the single mother said before hanging up. “I need to find this injection they told me to get for the boy.” CucutaNorte de Santanderpoverty ",https://colombiareports.com/starving-colombia-the-neighborhood-where-15-children-died-in-6-months/,Starving Colombia: the neighborhood where 15 children died in 6 months
" US intelligence agency CIA allegedly rehired a previously sacked agent after he was accused of ordering crimes against humanity in Colombia, a prosecutor told newspaper El Espectador.According to the newspaper, the anonymous prosecution official said he met James Lee Adkins in the US embassy in Bogota in 2003 and was told that the former security chief of US mining company Drummond  had again been hired by the CIA while a US court was investigating him for the murder of labor union leaders.Adkins was fired by the CIA in 1987 over his role in the so-called Iran-Contra affair, Special Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh reported in 1993.James L. Adkins was the chief of a CIA facility in Central America from January 1986 until May 1987. Independent Counsel found that from January 1986 until October 1986, when lethal U.S. Government aid to the contras was prohibited, Adkins knew and approved of contra-resupply missions by CIA pilots, in violation of the Boland Amendment. Independent Counsel also found that Adkins approved of the provision of thousands of dollars of aviation fuel to the contras — fuel that was mischarged to CIA accounts — and lied to investigators from the CIA’s Office of Inspector General about his activities. Despite the evidence, Independent Counsel concluded in November 1987 that he would not bring criminal charges against Adkins, principally because prosecution would not have advanced Independent Counsel’s investigation into the Iran/contra affair.Final report of the independent counsel for Iran/Contra mattersThe mysterious Mr. AdkinsThe Washington Post reported in 1991 that Adkins owned a private security firm in Florida and claimed that he was “one of the sacrificial lambs . . . identified by my superiors in Washington as the man they were going to throw overboard to placate Congress for the purpose of protecting themselves” after the Iran-Contra scandal broke.In 2003, however, “he told me that the CIA re-recruited him because he was gathering his best men to overthrow Saddam Hussein. He was very proud of that call. That was the last time I saw him” at the US embassy in Bogota, according to the prosecution official.Migration has no registry of the former CIA official from after August 2001, a month before the State Department declared the AUC a foreign terrorist organization.According to Drummond, Adkins stopped working for the mining company in December 2000, before he allegedly ordered the assassination of labor unionists and after his alleged complicity in the forced displacement of civilians.Adkins’ history in ColombiaDrummond has said they hired Adkins in June 1995. Migration registered his first entry to Colombia in July 1996 after which convicted businessman Jaime Blanco was contacted by former paramilitary commander “El Tigre” to seek a deal with Drummond that would allow the US coal miner to finance the “Bloque Norte.”Drummond executive Alfredo Araujo initially came to an agreement with Bloque Norte commander “Jorge 40,” according to multiple commanders.Adkins and Blanco, however, came up with a plan that would allow the US mining company to also directly finance the Juan Andres Alvarez Front of El Tigre, according to the businessman who provided food to Drummond.After Adkins told me of his plan to have Drummond financially support the AUC, I got in touch with El Tigre… I told El Tigre of the plan to provide El Tigre’s Front of the AUC, the Juan Andres Alvarez Front, 30 million Colombian pesos per month. Out of the monthly payments, 25 million Colombian pesos (which converted to dollars are roughly $13,000 USD) would be paid by Drummond, and 5 million Colombian pesos would be paid from my company, ISA.Jaime BlancoThe financing allowed the AUC unit to operate from the second half in 1996 until the demobilization of the Northern Bloc in 2006.Former paramilitary fighter “Miguel,” who assassinated the president and vice-president of Drummond’s labor union in March 2001, was sentenced in 2009 after both a US court and a Colombian court that the order had come from the very top of Drummond.Atkins mentioned that the decision to dismantle the union SINTRAMIENERGETICA was a direct order from Gary Drummond and Mike Tracy. That same day, Jim Atkins verbally gave Jaime Blanco the names of the Drummond unionists: Gustavo Soler, William Liscano, Yuris Pareja, Victor Guerra, Valmore Locarno, Victor Hugo Orcasita, Alejandro Vergara and Raul Sosa.“Miguel”The homicides took place after the CIA agent stopped working for Drummond, according to the mining company, but before he was last registered entering the country.In 2012, El Tigre told a US court about the horrors the group allegedly funded by Drummond had caused.Up to the year 2009, I had 720 killings that I confessed to and more than 2,000 displacements. There have been many more versions where I have accepted responsibility for many more killings, but to give you a count right now I really am not able to, but I would venture to say that it’s around a thousand, around a thousand, fifteen hundred approximately through the Juan Andres Alvarez Front.“El Tigre”By then, Adkins had flown and a US court absolved Drummond in 2015, claiming that the victims’ attorney had paid the paramilitary witnesses. Attorney Terry Collingsworth has denied this and Colombia’s prosecution never confirmed this claim.Instead, the prosecution in Bogota proceeded with the case in October 2018 and added the alleged CIA agent to the list of suspects, but the US embassy failed to locate Adkins, who — 17 years after he was allegedly seen last in the “bunker” — would be 85 if he is still alive.

" Colombia’s Supreme Court said Monday that it will continue investigating far-right former President Alvaro Uribe for allegedly conspiring with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2018 elections.The court said that it would not send the so-called “Ñeñepolitica” probe to the prosecution despite Uribe’s resignation from the Senate and renunciation of his congressional privilege in August.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersThe election rigging plot will remain in the Supreme Court because of the involvement of Uribe’s senatorial aides, the Supreme Court said on Twitter.The court did transfer investigations into the former president’s alleged witness tampering practices and ties to paramilitary groups to the prosecution because it found connection between these alleged crimes and Uribe’s former position as Senator.The decision is a setback for the former president and former Medellin Cartel associate who hoped his resignation would move all criminal cases against him to the prosecution where Uribe has more clout.The former president will additionally remain under house arrest until the Supreme Court takes a decision about which criminal code applies in the witness tampering investigation.Meanwhile, the court will proceed with the election fraud investigation that was kicked off early this year after independent media revealed evidence of ties between the ruling Democratic Center party and the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa.The scandal triggered investigations not just into Uribe, but also his party and President Ivan Duque who allegedly also plotted with money launderer Jose Guillermo Hernandez to defeat his opponent, Senator Gustavo Petro, in the heated 2018 elections.The slew of criminal investigations have severely discredited the former president and his party and put the legitimacy of Duque’s election as president into question.Despite decades of mounting evidence of Uribe’s ties to organized crime, the former president was able to successfully evade justice until his return to the senate in 2014 made his alleged criminal activity fall under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. 2018 electionsAlvaro Uribeelection fraudJose Guillermo HernandezUribe trial ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-supreme-court-wont-let-uribes-alleged-2018-election-fraud-slide/,Colombia’s Supreme Court won’t let Uribe’s alleged 2018 election fraud slide
" The return of former paramilitary leader “Jorge 40” to Colombia on Monday marks the beginning of a new period of hope for victims of the now-defunct AUC.Jorge 40, whose real name is Rodrigo Tovar, was one of the paramilitaries’ highest-ranking and most influential war lords whose return could shed a light on the countless crimes committed by the AUC and their associates in the military, government and private sector.His demobilization in 2006 triggered the so-called “parapolitics” scandal, but Tovar stopped talking to Colombian justice after his brother was assassinated in 2009, a year after the extradition of the former commander of the “Bloque Norte.”Tovar has requested to be allowed to submit to the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), the war crimes tribunal that is part of the peace process with the FARC.Only if the JEP grants him this request will Tovar be allowed to leave prison; his refusal to cooperate with justice from his US prison got him stripped from the judicial benefits granted after his demobilization.The secrets of ‘Jorge 40’, the warlord who owned Colombia’s Caribbean regionNow that the once mighty warlord is back in Colombia, Tovar con resume shedding light about his participation in the so-called “para-economy” that implicates multinationals like Chiquita Brands and Drummond, as well as countless Colombian companies.Unlike parapolitics, which led to the incarceration of more than 60 congressmen, the paramilitaries’ ties with the private sector and the military is still largely under wraps.Tovar and Salvatore Mancuso, one of this closest former associates, have said they want to testify about these matters, preferably before the JEP as the AUC’s ties former with the prosecution has complicated justice.Tovar’s victims have expressed hope that the former Bloque Norte commander’s return can bring them closure over the crimes committed during the AUC’s decade of terror between 1997 and 2006. armed conflictAUCJorge 40para-economicsparapoliticspeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/with-jorge-40-hope-returns-for-victims-of-colombias-armed-conflict/,"With ‘Jorge 40,’ hope returns for victims of Colombia’s armed conflict"

" Colombia’s Supreme Court condemned the government of far-right President Ivan Duque on Tuesday for violently repressing peaceful anti-government protests.In a historic ruling, the top court gave controversial Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo 48 hours to apologize for illegal attempts to violently quell peaceful protests in November.The ruling came a day after the resumption of the protests and ongoing criticism the increasingly authoritarian Duque was abusing his power to silence opposition.The constant disrespect for the superlative guarantees of people to exercise the right to peaceful, non-violent protest throughout the territory and the lack of state response to this situation is evident.Supreme CourtCourt orders police reformsThe Supreme Court ordered the government to come with a proposal to reform the National Police, and specifically the ESMAD anti-riot police, whose “uncontrolled activities represent a risk, a serious and ongoing threat for those who intend to go out and mobilize to peacefully express their opinions.”The court suspended the use of bean bag rifles that killed a protester in November and injured at least one protester on Monday.The government additionally was ordered to issue a “statute of reaction, use and verification of legitimate state force, and protection of the right to peaceful citizen protest” that would severely limit the police’s authority to use force.Court curtails government powerThe Supreme Court ordered the president to issue a gag order that disallows public officials to stigmatize protesters or criminalize democratic opposition within a month.This gag order is one of multiple reforms that seek to end the government’s “evident” disrespect and “systematic, violent and arbitrary” violations of Colombians’ right to protest.The Supreme Court found that the prosecution’s illegal raids were “dissuasive and stigmatizing for those who wish to exercise their prerogative to peaceful protest” based on “a presumption of guilt as a result of stigmatization” by the government.A nation that seeks to recover and build its democratic identity cannot locate the citizenry that legitimately protests in the rhetoric of friend and foe, left and right, good and bad, friends of peace and enemies of peace, but as the political expression that seeks to open space for dialogue, consensus and the non-violent reconstruction of the Constitutional State of Law.Supreme CourtThe ruling is a major victory for human rights NGO’s that had demanded court interference in Duque’s increasingly violent efforts to quell protests.Trujillo said he would “study” the court order to publicly apologize on national television, radio and on the internet. national strikepolice brutalitysocial protests ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-supreme-court-slams-governments-repression-of-protest/,Colombia’s Supreme Court condemns government’s violent repression of protest
" Colombia’s defense minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo defied all logic on Thursday, claiming he complied with a Supreme Court order to ask forgiveness for police brutality before it was issued.In one of his most absurd statements to date, Trujillo said that he complied with Tuesday’s court order on September 11 already.In compliance with the writ sentence STC7641 of September 22, 2020, with file number 11001-22-03-000-2019-02527-02, the ministry of defense would like to reiterate to the public opinion that on September 11, 2020, the defense minister — in a spontaneous, sincere, transparent and respectful act that was broadly emitted — stated that the National Police asked forgiveness for any breaking of the law or ignorance of regulations any of its members may incurred in.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes TrujilloAccording to the defense ministry, Trujillo’s apology “in relation to the death of Javier Humberto Ordoñez” on September 9 was in fact “a spontaneous act” that “referred to any violation of the law anytime.”The Supreme Court ordered Trujillo to apologize for the violent cracking down of peaceful protests in November last year and initiate reforms that would prevent abuse of police force.Colombia’s Supreme Court condemns government’s violent repression of protestThe defense minister’s nonsensical statement followed increased calls for Trujillo’s resignation to resign after the minister implied he had no intention of complying with the court order, putting him at risk of arrest for being in contempt of court.Hours after Trujillo’s self-proclaimed compliance with the court order, police in the city of Popayan violently cracked down on protests over the murder of a woman north of the capital of the Cauca province earlier that day.“Glory to the soldier!” the defense ministry tweeted after the sister of the victim published a video in which “we ask the National Police and the army ‘no more, please stop’.”The congressional opposition reiterated calls for the minister’s resignation.

" The controversial prosecutor in charge of trying Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe is being investigated on corruption charges, newspaper El Espectador reported Sunday.The preliminary investigation is the second controversy involving prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes, who previously conspired with jailed corrupt politicians to jail Carlos Caicedo, the current governor of the Magdalena province, but was never charged.Colombia’s chief prosecutor turns Uribe investigation into paramilitary jokeAccording to El Espectador, the controversial prosecutor was paid to do a job for an investigated retired army general while being employed by the prosecution.The preliminary investigation was opened by prosecutor Jorge Henan Diaz last year, before Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa promoted Jaimes and made him the superior of the prosecutor investigating him.After appointing the controversial prosecutor, Barbosa said Jaimes had carried out a number of “notable” investigations of which Colombia Reports could only find the one in which the prosecutor arbitrarily jailed Caicedo in an alleged act of political persecution.Colombia’s chief prosecutor too busy harassing critics to fight crime?Jaimes is a close ally of Colombia’s far-right ambassador to the Organization of American States, Alejandro Ordoñez, who illegally removed former Bogota Mayor Gustavo Petro from office when Ordoñez was Inspector General.The Supreme Court refused to to grant the petition of Senator Ivan Cepeda, the alleged victim of Uribe’s fraud and bribery practices, to recuse Barbosa and Jaimes, claiming they were impartial.The former president was placed under house arrest by the Supreme Court last month after the top court found enough evidence to file criminal charges against Uribe for allegedly manipulating witnesses to “take out” the opposition senator.The court forwarded multiple criminal investigations against the former president to the prosecution after Uribe resigned from the senate waiving his “privilege” to be tried by the Supreme Court.At one of the first virtual hearing last week, Jaimes said he wanted to try the former president under a different law, which would automatically lift the house arrest and allow the prosecutor to start the investigation that took the Supreme Court two years from scratch.  Alvaro UribeGabriel JaimesJudicial orderProsecutor General's OfficeUribe trial ",https://colombiareports.com/prosecutor-trying-colombias-former-president-facing-his-own-criminal-investigation/,Prosecutor trying Colombia’s former president facing his own criminal investigation

He has to comply with the law and court orders.Senator Jorge RobledoHow did Colombia get here?Trujillo was already under fire over the Bogota Massacre during which police allegedly murdered at least 14 people in the capital and the neighboring city of Soacha after indiscriminately opening fire during protests.In response to deadly police brutality during anti-government protests in November last year, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Trujillo, among other things, to publicly apologize within 48 hours.The defense minister failed to do so, claiming that he would ask the Constitutional Court to revise the ruling.The Bogota Massacre spurred the organizers of last year’s protests to call a new national strike on Monday and more strike days and marches in October and November.

" One of Colombia’s most prominent anti-corruption advocates said she will suspend her activism after her family received death threats.Political activist Catherine Juvinao gained prominence last year after launching a campaign called “Work, bums!” in which she exposed how often congressmen failed to show op at work.On Friday… my family received a death threat in relation to my activities as political activist. The message was sent via Whatsapp and said that either I shut up, because I talk too much, or they would kill two of my family members who they allegedly had located already.Political activist Catherine JuvinaoAccording to Juvinao, a fierce government critic, the threats to her family were the latest escalation of aggression she had been suffering for her political activism.“I have decided to self-censor myself from today on until receiving protection from the government.,” the political activist said on Twitter.According to Juvinao, the National Protection Unit (UNP) had assessed the risk of the political activist as “extraordinary,” but refused to grant her the protection measures that would correspond to this risk level.The UNP has been under criticism for years, including by its own personnel, for granting and refusing bodyguards and armored cars arbitrarily, leaving threatened critics of the administration of President Ivan Duque without adequate protection.Colombia granted protection meant for threatened human rights defenders to celebrities: unionI want to tell President Ivan Duque that you have the responsibility not just to protect the lives of those who voted for you, who think like you support your policies, but more than anything you have the duty to take care of those who don’t think like you, those who are critical of you or oppose you.Political activist Catherine JuvinaoThe Ombudsman’s Office said it would monitor the situation of the family of Juvinao, who took the opportunity to “ask for the protection of the hundreds of leaders and activists in the countryside who don’t have the means to make themselves heard.”Inspector General Fernando Carrillo said his office contacted the UNP, which did not respond to the latest accusation it was providing protection arbitrarily.  Catherine Juvinaocorruptiondeath threatsnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/death-threats-silence-one-of-colombias-most-prominent-anti-corruption-advocates/,Death threats silence one of Colombia’s most prominent anti-corruption advocates
" Colombia’s Supreme Court has said it would transfer and ongoing investigation into the alleged complicity of former President Alvaro Uribe in three massacres and a homicide to the prosecution.The court announced the decision on Tuesday after ruling that Uribe’s resignation from the senate stripped him of congressional privileges that allow the Supreme Court to investigate the former president’s alleged crimes.The Supreme Court issued a similar ruling in the trial over Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery practices to file false criminal charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda.Can Colombia’s prosecution try Uribe if it can’t even solve 95% of crimes?The leader of the far-right Democratic Center party resigned from the senate last month after the court placed him under house arrest over the alleged fraud and bribery committed to “do away with” Cepeda.The opposition senator had revealed the testimonies of two former members of the Bloque Metro paramilitary group who claimed that Uribe and his brother Santiago helped form the group in the late 1990’s when the former President was governor of his native Antioquia province.The La Granja Massacre and the San Roque massacre were committed by the Bloque Metro shortly after their formation in 2007.The El Aro massacre was committed by the ACCU paramilitary group in 1997 with the alleged knowledge of the far-right politician and political patron of President Ivan Duque.Was Uribe complicit in a 1997 paramilitary massacre?The homicide of human rights defender Jesus Maria Valle, who had warned Uribe ahead of the massacre in El Aro, was carried out by Medellin crime syndicate Oficina de Envigado, allegedly at the request Pedro Juan Moreno, Uribe’s right-hand man until his mysterious death after the two had fallen out in 2006.The transfer of the cases to the notoriously politicized Prosecutor General’s Office are a major victory for Uribe as the prosecution if run by Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, a close friend of Duque.The Supreme Court rejected Cepeda’s claim that Barbosa’s alleged conflict of interests were enough to recuse the chief prosecutor, who appointed an extremely dodgy prosecutor on the fraud and bribery case.A lower court will rule on Tuesday whether it will uphold the Supreme Court’s house arrest or allow the prosecution to start the investigation that started in 2018 from scratch.

" Top United Nations officials expressed their “deep concern” over Colombia’s “climate of insecurity and violence” in a conversation with President Ivan Duque on Thursday.In a virtual meeting with Duque and his post-conflict coordinator Emilio Archila, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo stressed “the insecurity affecting the lives of too many Colombians in conflict-affected areas of the country, notwithstanding the overall reduction in violence brought about by the peace process.”The American official urged that “more needs to be done about what the UN Mission Chief in Colombia, Carlos Ruiz, called a “climate of insecurity and violence.”We remain deeply concerned about the insecurity affecting the lives of too many Colombians in conflict-affected areas of the country, notwithstanding the overall reduction in violence brought about by the peace process. We condemn the violence by illegal armed groups that has continued unabated even amid a global health crisis. The killings and threats against social leaders, former combatants, women and young people are a threat to peace. We acknowledge the efforts by Colombian authorities, communities and local leaders to address this serious challenge. We all recognize more needs to be done.UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarloDiCarlos reiterated called on Duque to adhere to the call of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for a global ceasefire.The ELN, the country’s last standing guerrilla group, initially declared a unilateral ceasefire in response to Guterres earlier this year, but ended this a month later after the president insisted on perpetuating the armed conflict that began in 1964.Ongoing fighting with the ELN and smaller groups has a “deleterious effect” on the implementation of the peace process, according to Ruiz.The deleterious effects upon security guarantees are not allowing communities, former combatants and institutions from fully realizing their potential to build peace and therefore delaying the transformations provided for in the Agreement and the expectations of Colombians for peace.UN Mission chief Carlos RuizDuque said “there are issues that we must work on harder, such as the threat of drug trafficking; the criminal groups that kill social leaders, which we face, and the challenge of justice so that there is truth, justice, reparation and non-repetition.”The far-right president has been under persistent criticism for failing to implement the peace deal between former FARC guerrillas and his predecessor Juan Manuel Santos, which is fiercely opposed by his party. armed conflictCarlos RuizIvan Duquepeace processUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/climate-of-insecurity-and-violence-persists-in-colombia-un/,Climate of insecurity and violence persists in Colombia: UN

This is how the mayor’s criticism in the media is being avenged leaving more than ten deaths. They want a lethal body against protests that will remain in impunity because they know that the people will take to the streets.Senator Gustavo PetroDefense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo almost immediately asked forgiveness for police crimes committed, implying he takes responsibility for the terror campaign.The Inspector General announced he would be investigating the alleged state terrorism and file criminal charges against those involved, which has put the very legitimacy of the entire government on the line.Abusive police behavior that violates human rights, with the use of force against citizens, breaks with the duty of the security forces.Inspector General Fernando CarrilloThe Bogota City Council has rejected the police violence that killed at least 15 residents and expressed its support for Lopez, who “urgently invited” Duque to talk. He accepted a meeting at 3PM on Friday.Two hours later, Lopez will meet with Inspector General Fernando Carrillo, who already had been warned about government officials’ refusal to accept the house arrest of Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.Because of the president’s persistent difficulty to abide with the law, Duque appears to have blown his political support and has lost all control over the situation.Lopez, on the other hand, appears to be very much in control, especially after receiving support from key lawmakers, her city council and the Inspector General.According to the Bogota mayor, she will try to reestablish constitutional order together with the inspector general and the president.I have dedicated my life to defending our Constitution and democracy. We have faced and overcome dark times. We will also get through the current ones. We have to guarantee the constitutional functioning of all institutions and the rights of young people and citizens.Bogota Mayor Claudia LopezTrujillo taking responsibility for the police killings could mean he is willing to step down to save Duque, who formally is commander-in-chief.The alleged use of state terrorism to undermine Lopez, the second most powerful public official in Colombia, could mean that the Bogota Mayor will want more than Trujillo’s head.After two years of mind-boggling misrule, Duque appears to have completely lost control and may have little to say in Friday’s meetings other than “yes, sir”  to the inspector general and “yes, ma’am” to Bogota’s mayor.

" Colombia’s defense minister forgot to get rid of evidence proving he personally coordinated the Bogota Massacre in which police murdered seven people and injured at least 72 on Wednesday and Thursday.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said on Wednesday evening he was in charge of the security forces while police were carrying out what Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez called “an authentic massacre.”Evidence of state terror campaign left on social mediaEvidence that far-right President Ivan Duque’s chief of staff Diego Molano, Vice-Interior Minister Daniel Palacios, Armed Forces commander Luis Navarro and acting National Police director General Gustavo Moreno were with Trujillo during the massacre was later found online.The defense minister was called to Congress on Saturday, but that would be the least of his worries.The government claim that he led what Lopez called “the most serious event that has happened in Bogota since the Palace of Justice siege” of 1985 would be enough to get him and the other top officials in court.Until Sunday morning, nobody had even bothered to delete the evidence confirming Trujillo, Navarro and Moreno were leading the two-day state terrorism campaign while Molano presumably kept the president informed.President Ivan Duque’s Chief of Staff Diego Molano, Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, acting National Police Chief Gustavo Moreno and Armed Forces commander Luis Navarro during the Bogota Massacre.The Bogota massacre timelineTrujillo and the acting National Police chief arrived at the military command post before 7:38PM when they published a tweet in which Trujillo announced “the legitimate use of state force” in response to unrest in that followed the brutal killing of an unarmed man in the capital early that morning.The National Police on a national level has been instructed to take all necessary measures, not just to protect the lives and integrity of the citizens in the face of the violent events and violence that are taking place.

His appearance at the annual commemoration of human rights was already controversial as the president announced he would attend the event with his human rights adviser Nancy Patricia Gutierrez, who — of all things — is facing a criminal investigation for using terrorism to get into Congress in 2006.The increasingly authoritarian Duque was already under severe criticism for using extreme violence to crack down on anti-government protests in November last year, because the president reportedly considered citizens exercising their constitutional right an act of insurgency.At Duque’s request, UN backs crushing human rights report on ColombiaAccording to the president, he would meet with “will participate in a conversation with young people about human rights, in order to hear their perspectives and reflections.”Press will not be allowed to attend the event due to “biosafety protocols,”coincidentally preventing the pesky journalists asking inconvenient questions about the list of human rights violations that has been growing under Duque.Widespread police brutality, the mass killing of human rights defenders and the use of the military to spy on journalists nearly forced the United Nations’ Human Rights Office to abandon Bogota last year.

" Colombia’s State Council dealt victims of state violence a major blow on Tuesday confirming that damage caused by an army homicide is no different than damage caused by a pothole.The country’s highest administrative court rejected the appeal of an earlier decisions in which the State Council ruled that victims of state violence who hadn’t requested compensation within two years of their crime lost their right to demand compensation.Victims rights organizations asked the State Council to be more lenient with conflict victims as many were too afraid to request compensation from their own victimizer within such a short period of time.The ruling followed an appeal of the family of Clodomiro Coba, who was murdered by the military on April 6, 2007 and falsely presented as a FARC guerrilla killed in combat.The family didn’t request compensation until 2014, the year the prosecution said that the military had assassinated at least 4,000 civilians to inflate the success in the armed conflict with the FARC.This was five years too late, according to the State Council.Yolman Pidiachi, Clodomiro Coba and Beyer Ignacio Perez were shot dead on April 6, 2007 in the village of Las Tapias in the municipality of Hato Corozal (Casanare). The members of the National Army… informed in writing and in their inquiries that the above were killed in combat because they were members of the 28th Front of the so-called Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC. The excuse does not coincide with the truth, since hours before the victims were in a store located in the village of El Caucho de Nunchía , where they were chatting before going to a job for which they had been hired. They were taken out of the store by several soldiers who tied their hands behind their backs and put them into a van.

" The possible return of paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso to Colombia revives the question who is behind the far-right terror that continued after the demobilization of paramilitary organization AUC.Colombia’s Supreme Court has sentenced more than 65 former Congressmen and at least seven governors, but the prosecution almost exclusively prosecuted members of the military arm of The Paramilitary Project.The former presidentsAndres Pastrana and Alvaro UribeColombia’s Supreme Court is currently investigating former President Alvaro Uribe for his key role in the formation and expansion of the AUC while he was governor in Antioquia and president.There is evidence Uribe has been tied to organized crime since he entered politics under the wing of the Medellin Cartel in 1980, but his formation of almost 80 legal paramilitary groups when he was governor in the late 1990’s and his controversial demobilization of the AUC after they helped him become president has triggered most suspicion.Uribe was not the only president who received electoral support from the paramilitaries, extradited paramilitary chief “Jorge 40” said in 2008. His subordinates of the so-called “Bloque Norte” were instructed to secure the election of Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana in 1998.Both presidents are fierce opponents of the peace process, and particularly Uribe has increasingly been inciting hatred, which in some cases was followed up by death threats of far-right group “Aguilas Negras.”Why Colombia’s former president is accused of forming bloodthirsty death squadsThe former chief prosecutorsLuis Camilo Osorio, Mario Iguaran, Viviane Morales and Nestor Humberto Martinez.Exiled former prosecutor Richard Maok fled to Canada in 2002 after discovering that his own boss, former Prosecutor General Luis Camilo Osorio, allegedly was part of the paramilitary network.The investigation against Osorio, like those against other chief prosecutor was assumed by the notoriously ineffective Accusations Committee of the House of Representatives, which has come to no more than one conviction since its inception in 1991.A Medellin court ordered the investigation of former Prosecutor General Viviane Morales on charges of criminal neglect in the criminal investigations of former National Army commander General Mart Montoya and Medellin’s former police chief, General Leonardo Gallego.Maok’s investigation additionally linked former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez to the AUC while Mancuso has testified that rancher federation chief Jose Felix Lafaurie sought his support for the 2005 election of Prosecutor general Mario Iguaran.Colombia court urges investigation of former chief prosecutor for ties to AUCThe private sectorEcopetrol’s office in BogotaThe most important members of the paramilitaries are some of the most powerful members of Colombia’s business elite, who didn’t just see the death squads as complementary self-defense forces, but as terrorist tools to expand their business interests either by killing labor unionists or stealing land in what has popularly become known as “para-economics.”Among the companies are major international brands like Glencore and Chiquita, whose ships were used for illegal arms imports, and major local firms like state-run oil company Ecopetrol, cement company Argos, soft drink company Postobon, ladies underwear company Leonidas and and countless ranchers, miners and plantation owners.I gave the prosecution lists with 270 banana growers, 400 cattle ranchers and possibly thousands of business owners. The prosecution does not have the capacity to investigate what happened in Uraba, but there is no political will either. They would wipe out one fifth of the national economy.Former paramilitary chief and banana plantation owner Raul HasbunMany of these companies supported the candidacy of President Ivan Duque, whose far-right party has tried to complicate procedures for victims of land theft to reclaim their land while the government has been reluctant to implement the peace process that would allow the dismantling of paramilitary structures, some of whom are making sure no victim of displacement reclaims their property.Former Vice-Prosecutor General Fernando Perdomo said in 2015 his office had identified 39,000 alleged paramilitary financiers.  Martinez, who is accused of paramilitary ties himself, last year only said to have 4,800 suspects.Only a few dozen businessmen voluntarily submitted to the country’s war crimes tribunal while others have been accused of perpetuating paramilitary violence to defend their interests.ICC looking into Colombia’s private sector terrorism support: reportThe mediaMedellin newspaper El ColombianoColombia’s media played a key role in the promotion of the AUC, in some cases because their editors were ideologically aligned with the far-right organization, in other cases they allegedly conspired to commit terrorism.The most important media that have been implicated in the scandal are the country’s largest newspaper, El Tiempo, and private television network RCN.According to Mancuso, he was invited to El Tiempo’s newsroom by Colombia’s current ambassador to Washington DC, Francisco Santos, to promote the AUC among the journalists and editors. Santos, who was editor-in-chief at the time, as well as far-right columnists like Maria Isabel Rueda and Salud Hernandez were openly promoting the paramilitaries.Possibly the most painful case is that of El Meridiano from the northern Cordoba province, whose owner Eduardo Padilla is under investigation for his alleged tied to the AUC’s former military commander.According to the court, El Meridiano glorified death squad commanders. Victims decried “the way in which this newspaper reported on events in which their relatives were victims of the armed group outside the law, since they were repeatedly shown as guerrillas,” court record showed.‘Love for Medellin’: how state propaganda and terrorism instilled a culture of fear in Colombia’s 2nd largest cityThe former generalsGeneral Mario Montoya (Image: JEP)Colombia’s security forces aligned themselves with the paramilitaries in the 1980’s when both were still working with Medellin Cartel in the Antioquia province.After the American authorities decided to get rid of Escobar in 1992, the DEA, the CIA, the Cali Cartel, the paramilitaries who would later found the AUC and members from the security teamed up.This resulted in close ties between the AUC and particularly commanders of the 7th Division, which is stationed in Medellin.By 1997, however, these ties had become so broad that the AUC had contacts with the military throughout the country through front companies called CONVIVIR.The most infamous paramilitary allies are Uribe’s former National Army chief General Mario Montoya and General Rito Alejo del Rio, who rose through the military ranks while Uribe was making political career.The military, however, has hardly been cooperative, making it unclear how many top commanders were engaging the AUC’s terrorism practices.Like with the businessmen, multiple military units have been accused of still using paramilitary forces. para-economicsparamediaparamilitariesparapolitics ",https://colombiareports.com/who-is-behind-the-paramilitaries-terror-in-colombia/,Who is behind the paramilitary terror in Colombia?
" Colombia’s ruling party has joined a campaign to intimidate the victim of former President Alvaro Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery practices, opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda.The lawmaker showed news program Noticias Uno evidence that 16 lawmakers of the far-right Democratic Center party of Uribe and President Ivan Duque have been bombarding him with requests for information, including private information he under no circumstance is obliged to disclose.Duque’s far-right buddy weighs inLuis Guillermo Echeverri and Ivan DuqueThe same news program showed a letter by one of President Ivan Duque’s best friends, Luis Guillermo Echeverri, in which the far-right ideologue asked Spanish newspaper El Pais not to interview Uribe’s victims.The offensive of Uribe’s far-right supporters followed death threats against Cepeda, his family and his defense attorney and an ongoing disinformation campaign by Colombia’s leading weekly, Semana.Cepeda became the victim of Uribe’s alleged criminal practices that cost the former president his political career in 2014 when the far-right politician failed false charges against the lawmaker.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonHate campaign intensified after house arrestAlvaro UribeThe Supreme Court absolved the opposition senator in 2018 and announced an investigation into Uribe who allegedly bribed witnesses to support his false accusations and discredit the testimonies of former paramilitaries who accused the former president and his brother of forming death squads in the 1990’s.After the court placed Uribe under house arrest last month, the former president resigned from the senate, effectively renouncing his congressional privilege that gave the Supreme Court the authority to investigate.The political suicide of the far-right politician and former Medellin Cartel associate intensified his supporters’ attacks on Cepeda, politicians promoting an ongoing peace process and critics.Senana columnists Vicky Davila and Salud Hernandez, who took part in political warfare campaigns against critics when Uribe was president, have been dedicating themselves to trying to discredit the witness confirming the far-right leader’s paramilitary ties with disinformation.Colombia’s leading weekly joins Uribe’s dirty war against justiceAfter a third Semana columnist, renowned journalist Maria Jimena Duzman, argued Uribe’s increasingly extremist attitude was “fascist,” she became the victim of a smear campaign and received threats by the far-right politician’s followers.President Ivan Duque has refused to distance himself from his his political patron’s increasingly incendiary tactics.

" Rodrigo Tovar, the former warlord who virtually owned Colombia’s Caribbean coast and its politicians, wants to talk after years of silence.The former commander of the AUC’s Northern Bloc is expected to return from the United States, where he spent 12 years in prison for drug trafficking, later this month.Lots of people with good reasons to be nervousThe return of Tovar, a.k.a. “Jorge 40,” should make a lot of people nervous, even the bosses of Chiquita, the company that started with bananas and ended up implicated in arms trafficking.Former President Alvaro Uribe also has reasons to worry as Tovar could easily get the shady prosecutor who is supposed to be trying Uribe on fraud and bribery charges in prison.The former paramilitary commander never got the chance to talk about the prosecutors in his pocket because Uribe extradited Tovar and 13 other AUC leaders to the US in May 2008.Tovar has only been heard eight times, but by then the paramilitaries’ confessions had even gotten the former president’s cousin Mario in trouble for his narco ties.Following his extradition, the former Bloque Norte commander continued cooperating with Colombian justice, but bailed out in 2010 as US justice was trying Tovar for drug trafficking.Mr. ParapoliticsThe return of Tovar is particularly interesting because he was one of the AUC’s most politically active leaders in between allegedly ordering 330 massacres.Months after his demobilization a day before the 2006 congressional elections, prosecutors found evidence on Tovar’s computer that the AUC leader helped political dynasties from the Caribbean region get elected into Congress and agreed he would fake paramilitary demobilization processes in the northern Sucre and Bolivar provinces.A judge revoked the AUC commander’s judicial benefits in 2015 after ruling Tovar had not complied with his Colombian court obligations while complying with his US court obligations.As far as Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos goes, Tovar is done getting other people in trouble, but the former AUC chief is hoping for a second chance, spilling his beans before the war crimes tribunal that was set up after the demobilization of guerrilla group FARC.The so-called Special Jurisdiction for Peace rejected Tovar’s initial request in January, but gave him a shot if he can prove he financed the AUC before actively joining the group.

" The death of a UN peace observer appears to be linked to the leaking of evidence that triggered the resignation of Colombia’s former defense minister, according to newspaper El Espectador.The body of peace observer Mario Paciolla from Italy was found in his home on July 15, five days before he hoped to end his volunteer job as a peace observer in the southern town of San Vicente del Caguan.Friends and family immediately disputed the local police’s claim that Paciolla had committed suicide as the Italian had told his mother he was “in trouble” the evening before a was found dead.“Colombia isn’t safe for me anymore,” the UN volunteer wrote a few days before his death, according to newspaper El Espectador.Colombia investigating UN peace observer’s disputed ‘suicide’Peace observer concerned about leaked reportMultiple UN volunteers told the newspaper that their colleague may have been assassinated after evidence that the Colombian military killed at least eight forcibly recruited minors in the bombing of the camp of a FARC dissident he and several other colleagues found had leaked.Former Defense Minister Guillermo Botero was forced to resigned in November last year after Senator Roy Barreras ( U Party) made evidence of the bombing public during a debate.Paciolla told people close to him later that month that he and other peace observers suffered cyber attacks immediately after the scandal broke.Paciolla went home to Naples later that month where he asked French cultural websites to delete poets from him they had published, deleted photos from himself and friends from social media, and put his Facebook on private, reported El Espectador.Paciolla returned from his vacation in Italy on December 27, returned to San Vicente del Caguan, but asked for the transfer that never happened.On June 11, a little more than a month before his death, the peace observer wrote a friend that “Colombia is not safe for me anymore. I don’t want to set another foot in this country or in the UN.”Duque presented bombed minors and children as ‘narco-terrorist criminals’Tensions between UN and former Colombia’s defense ministerIn the months before Barreras effectively ejected Botero, the former defense minister was reportedly lobbying not to extend the mandate of UN Mission chief Carlos Ruiz, which was causing frustration within the UN office.According to El Espectador, multiple sources confirmed that Botero on several occasions refused to receive Ruiz and on one occasion thanked the top UN official for his work and told him that “we will take it from here.”Paciolla told friends he had requested a transfer after finding out that UN officials working under Verification chief Raul Rosende had leaked the information he had gathered about the bombing to Barreras, according to the newspaper.Several UN sources said that former Colombian navy captain Omar Cortes, who had been hired by the UN, leaked the information.The senator denies he received information from UN officials and told El Espectador he received the information from sources within the military.Ruiz reportedly was not informed about the apparent political hit job in violation of UN regulations, according to El Espectador.No UN official agreed to respond to El Espectador’s questions, but seven people working in the UN confirmed that confidential information was being emailed and that UN officials were celebrating Botero’s resignation.Colombia’s defense minister resigns ahead of no confidence voteThe questionable investigationColombia’s prosecution ordered an investigation into local police officials who reportedly allowed officials of the United Nations’ Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to recover Paciolla’s belongings and clean up his apartment before the prosecution could conduct a proper investigation into his death.The SIU did not just make a forensic investigation into the Italian’s death impossible, but also kept elements that may be relevant for an investigation from the prosecution without sending them back to his family, according to El Espectador.One of these belongings was the blood-stained mouse from Paciolla that was found in the UN’s main office in Bogota after the SIU had cleaned up the apartment, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, under the command of retired National Army official Christian Leonardo Thompson, the UN’s security chief in Caqueta.The late UN volunteer’s family has yet to receive any of their loved one’s belongings, according to El Espectador.The Paciolla family’s attorney in Colombia, German Romero, told the newspaper he has been denied insight in any of the investigations into the peace observers death or the alleged leaking of classified material.The prosecution refused to comment on the investigation like the UN, which has closed its office in San Vicente del Caguan.Contrary to the peace observer’s friends and family, nobody in Colombia has shown interest in who killed Paciolla and why.

" The son of Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe has hired a Washington DC lobbying firm for $40,000 a month while his father is sinking deeper into legal trouble, the Associated Press reported Sunday.According to AP, Tomas Uribe hired DCI group that claims to “specializes in public relations, crisis management, grassroots engagement, and digital advocacy.”Uribe is most definitely in crisis as he is under house arrest on fraud and bribery charges, and facing additional charges he allegedly was complicit in three massacres, a homicide and election fraud.The Uribe family apparently believes that political pressure from Washington DC may convince Colombia’s Supreme Court to drop the charges that have suspended his political career and put him away for life.The far-right politician and former Medellin Cartel associate has long wielded political power with great talent, but has had the worst luck in court, despite witness assassinations.The politician’s son signed the lobbying contract on August 20, according to a filing of the foreign agents registration act foreign citizens and companies must sign before being allowed to lobby US Congress.Uribe has consistently tried to use political and public pressure to influence the court, which has been investigating him since 2018 after finding he may have bribed witnesses to file false charges against an opposition senator.The former president and political patron of President Ivan Duque abandoned his senate seat earlier this month in the hope the Supreme Court will forward his case to the notoriously corrupt prosecution.According to Uribe’s attorney, Jaime Granados, the Supreme Court is violating the former president’s rights, a claim that has been denied by the court.The Supreme Court may decide to forward his case to the prosecution if it finds that the crimes the former president allegedly committed were unrelated to his work as a congressman.Uribe’s son hiring a $40,000/month lobbyist indicated the president isn’t so certain depending only on the court, where his alleged attempts to buy more witnesses to get rid of the witness tampering charges only got him deeper in trouble.

" Colombia’s defense minister may have to tell the US government he screwed up the involvement of American soldiers in counternarcotics operations for the second time in three months.Approximately 50 US “advisers” resumed joint operations with Colombia’s National Army in coca eradication operations in July after Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said he had received congressional approval.Trujillo lied, could be in contempt of court and is close to embarrassing himself again.All the defense minister had was a letter of 69 senators saying they were in favor of US support for the military operations that was suspended by a court in June because the minister failed to ask permission from Congress.Former Senate President Lidio Garcia on Monday explained that the senators’ letter in no way authorized foreign military activity, but expressed their commitment to vote in favor of the US support.The defense minister presumably failed to tell the American embassy that the letter literally said that “this message has no judicial value whatsoever.”In other words, the resumption of the 53 American soldiers’s activity ignored the court order and is as illegal as their initial involvement was in June and must return to their barracks.Facing his latest humiliation, the defense minister on Tuesday again denied he needed congressional approval to allow American support for domestic military operations, contradicting both the law and the court sentence that have the US soldiers 48 hours to return to their barracks.Opposition Senator Jorge Robledo announced on Tuesday he had asked President Ivan Duque to remove Trujillo from his post for “having lied, being in contempt of the Senate and inducing the Government to break the law.”President Ivan Duque has yet to sack a minister and Congress has yet to accept being held in contempt by one of the administration’s ministers, leaving Trujillo little option but to tell the US Embassy he screwed up again.

" Former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was told in 2004 that Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe “almost certainly” had ties to paramilitaries and that a memo on ties to Pablo Escobar was real, according to the National Security Archive.Despite the fact that the AUC was considered a foreign terrorist organization at the time, President George W Bush awarded the former Medellin Cartel associate a Medal of Freedom in 2009 for “confronting terrorism.”Uribe called to testify over 3 massacres 10 years after receiving Medal of Freedom for ‘opposing terrorism’Rumsfeld was informed that Uribe “almost certainly had dealings with the paramilitaries” while the Colombian president was in the process of demobilizing the organization founded in 1997 after Uribe’s promotion of private security companies that allowed the paramilitaries to receive legal funding.The pentagon official told Rumsfeld that “we have no reports to suggest that drugs were part of the picture.”According to a former member of the “Bloque Metro” Uribe and his brother Santiago allegedly helped found, there were “laboratories” on the “Guacharacas” estate of the Uribe family.When international media revealed the 1991 memo mentioning Uribe as a close ally of the Medellin Cartel, the US government said the memo was a draft and never confirmed.A cable sent from from the US embassy to Washington DC in April 1997 spoke of Conservative Senator Jorge Alveiro Valencia’s kidnapping by paramilitaries near San Roque, the town where the Uribe family and their drug trafficking neighbors had allegedly founded the “Bloque Metro” a year before.When the kidnappers learned that the congressman knew “the old guy” they let him go, Valencia told the embassy official.Uribe is currently being investigated by the Supreme Court for three massacres, one of which was carried out by the “Bloque Metro.”Why Colombia’s former president is accused of forming bloodthirsty death squadsA second investigation, which has the former president under house arrest, focuses on Uribe’s alleged attempts to manipulate former paramilitaries who have testified that the former president and his brother Santiago help found the group.Uribe admitted to being close friends with the Ochoa crime family, which founded the Medellin cartel, since he was young.

" Colombia’s Inspector General sided with former President Alvaro Uribe on Tuesday, claiming the investigations into witness tampering ought to be transferred to the prosecution.In its press release, Inspector General Fernando Carrillo referred specifically to the fraud and bribery investigation, leaving a more recent investigation into three massacres and a homicide with the court.Uribe called to testify over 3 massacres 10 years after receiving Medal of Freedom for ‘opposing terrorism’The court was still deliberating about the request of Uribe’s defense attorney to forward the prosecution or to continue the investigation it has been carrying out since early 2018.The Inspector General’s Office requested the Special Instruction Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice to transfer the investigation it is carrying out against former Senator Alvaro Uribe for the alleged crimes of bribery in criminal proceedings and procedural fraud, because with the resignation of his seat he lost the competence to continue with the processes related to common crimes.Inspector General’s OfficeAccording to the Inspector General’s Office, Uribe’s resignation from the Senate made him lose his privilege to be investigated by the Supreme Court, making the investigation a matter of the prosecution.The court ultimately  decides on this decision based on whether the alleged crimes allegedly carried out while enjoying his congressional privilege were related to his position as Senator.Opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, the victim of Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery practices urged the court over the weekend not to transfer the investigation to the notoriously politicized prosecution, claiming Uribe’s position as senator were key to the former president bringing false charges against his rival based on manipulated witness statementThe inspector weighting in is likely to increase tensions between the Supreme Court and Uribe, who has claimed the Supreme Court was violating his rights.The unprecedented situation is monitored by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges & Lawyers, who said last week that “judicial independence and the separation of powers, essential principles of democracy and the rule of law, includes respect for the decisions of the Supreme Court.” Alvaro UribeInspector General's OfficeUribe trial ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-inspector-general-asks-supreme-court-to-transfer-uribe-fraud-and-bribery-case-to-prosecution/,Colombia’s inspector general asks Supreme Court to transfer Uribe fraud and bribery case to prosecution
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque-proposed to use the euphemism “collective homicide” instead of “massacre,” but was ignored after two particularly violent weeks.Duque coined the euphemism used by the military earlier this week after five massacres and several other mass killings shocked the country and sparked fears of a relapse to the extreme violence of the beginning of the century.Many people have said: “the massacres are back, the massacres are back.” First let’s use the precise term: “collective homicides,” and sadly we have to accept as a country, that they are not back, it’s that these acts of ‘collective homicides’ have not gone away sadly.President Ivan DuqueMassacres had all but disappeared after Duque’s predecessor, President Juan Manuel Santos, closed a peace deal with leftist FARC guerrillas in 2016 that is fiercely opposed by the president’s far-right Democratic Center party.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo subsequently repeated the term, denied any responsibility in the deterioration of public security and vaguely blamed “drug trafficking” for the massacres.It hurts us all but it is reality. Collective homicides are not something new in the country, it has been happening for many years. It is not true that it has been reactivated with the Duque administration. The collective homicides have a common denominator: drug trafficking.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes TrujilloThe’parents of victims of a massacre in the southwestern Nariño province blasted authorities for implying their children were somehow associated with drug trafficking.None of the massacres this month appeared to be related to drug trafficking in any way, but Trujillo tried to use the massacres to seek support for his so-far failed attempts to resume the aerial fumigation of coca.Independent media blasted the government for trying to whitewash the extreme violence and even use it to promote unpopular policies.Unlike during the conflict, most of the country’s mass media ignored the president’s suggestion and continued to use the word “massacre.”Several studies conducted during the country’armed conflict indicated that the mass media’s use of euphemisms in cases of violence committed by paramilitaries severely distorted public perception of the current reality in Colombia.Colombia Reports uses the word “massacre” for mass killings that leave more than four civilians dead and uses the term “multiple homicide” in armed attacks that leave two or three fatal victims. armed conflictIvan Duquemassacressocial violence ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-trying-to-whitewash-massacres-by-coining-term-collective-homicides/,Colombia trying to whitewash massacres by coining term ‘collective homicides’
" With the election of Colombia’s former justice minister as inspector general on Wednesday, all the country’s watchdogs have fallen under the control of President Ivan Duque’s allies.The Senate elected former Justice Minister Margarita Cabello to lead the Inspector General’s Office, the last watchdog institution that was independent from the Duque administration. No checks and balances?While Colombia’s traditional parties and allies of the president were quick to congratulate the new inspector general, opposition senators expressed their concern that Cabello is now expected to scrutinize the government she was a member of until earlier this month.The fact that in Colombia the main control body is run by a former minister of the current government is a clear demonstration of the absence of democracy and the lack of independent monitoring of the executive branch’s whims in fashion with totalitarian states.Senator Ivan CepedaOutgoing Inspector General Fernando Carrillo congratulated the former minister, stressing that “the continuity of the defense of the constitution and the rule of law are in your hands.”Carrillo scolded Duque and his administration for abusing their power in defense of the president’s political patron and a long-time ally of Cabello, former President Alvaro Uribe.The former president, who is currently under house arrest on fraud and bribery charges, put Cabello as candidate chief prosecutor on his presidential short list in 2009 that was ignored bu the Supreme Court that considered none of the candidate suitable.Abuses of power already evidentKnowing that Carrillo would leave office and Cabello’s election was almost certain, Duque and his ministers continued ignoring the law to defend their political patron.Interior Minister Alicia Arango on Wednesday endorsed a claim by the president that “all of us in Colombia are indebted” with their political patron, who is also under investigation by the Supreme Court for his alleged role in a plot to rig the 2018 election and multiple massacres in the 1990’s.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa and Comptroller General Felipe Cordoba last month took their families on vacation to the Caribbean island of San Andres pretending to be investigating corruption.Barbosa, a personal friend of the president, has been fiercely criticized for trumping up charges against critics of Duque while bungling investigations against allies.

" Colombia’s transport minister appeared clueless on Tuesday in regards to how and when international air travel that was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic would be reestablished.In an interview with RCN Radio, Transport Minister Angela Maria Orozco said that the ban on foreign visitors will be lifted on September 1, but added that no date has been set to allow the entry of incoming flights.The minister said she hoped to have specific information later this week after receiving recommendations from the Health Ministry.Decree 569 that restricts the entrance of international travelers, allows the Civil Aeronautics to eliminate the restriction with previous approval of the Ministry of Health. This proposal has already been presented and we are waiting for the answer, which as far as we know would come in the course of this week.Transport Minister Angela Maria OrozcoDepending on the Health Ministry, incoming travelers will “probably” have to show that they tested negative for COVID-19, said Orozco, who was evidently clueless of what was going on.The decree mentioned by the minister is from April and sought to regulate humanitarian flights only.A decree that would allow international air travel the begin restarting appears to still be in the making.A plan by civil aviation agency Aerocivil to restart international travel that was leaked last month revealed that incoming travel would initially only be allowed for business travelers and not open the country for tourists until November.Aerocivil director Juan Carlos Salazar told newspaper El Espectador earlier this month that he expected to need “at least a year” to normalize international air travel.According to Orozco, Salazar’s agency is currently negotiating with foreign governments “to see with which countries routes could be re-established and under what conditions.”The minister admitted that of the almost 200 countries in the world, only “three or four” have no incoming travel restrictions.Two of these countries, Brazil and Mexico, also are among the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus. air travelMaria Angela Orozco ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-transport-minister-clueless-about-restart-international-air-travel/,Colombia’s transport minister clueless about restart international air travel
" The governments of Colombia and the United States want to resume aerial fumigation and continue the forced eradication of coca that cost $20 billion between 2005 and 2014 without any significant result.Opposition Senator Ivan Marulanda (Green Alliance) published the mind-boggling expense sheet of the bilateral counternarcotics program President Ivan Duque and his US counterpart Donald Trump want to restart.In the response, the government admitted that voluntary crop substitution, which is opposed by both Bogota and Washington DC, is both cheaper and more effective.They calculated forced eradication between 2005 and 2014 at a cost of COP23 million/hectare when eradicated manually and COP72 million/hectare when eradicated by aerial spraying. This what was approximately:COP7.9 trillion ($2 billion) in forced eradicationCOP79.9 trillion ($20 billion) in eradication through aerial fumigationWhich amounts to a total of COP88 trillion ($22 billion) in 10 years and COP8.8 trillion (2.2 billion) on average per yearComparing this data with the estimated cost of substitution with the families directly included at a rate of COP40 million ($10.3 thousand) producing families out of an estimated total of 80,438 direct producer families, this would imply an investment of COP2.9 billion ($748 thousand).Based on the above, it can be said that the cost-benefit ratio of substitution is more reasonable than eradication because the results achieved are expected to be sustainable over time.President’s OfficeMarulanda was already a fierce opponent of the strategy even before finding that both governments had spent $22 billion on a strategy that in the end barely combated coca cultivation.According to the opposition senator, Bogota and Washington spent more on the ineffective counternarcotics strategy in 10 years than Colombia’s government invested in agriculture, which is broadly considered a far more effective counternarcotics strategy, in half a century.Marulanda is currently co-sponsoring a bill to regulate coca and cocaine.Colombia to kick off congressional year with cocaine decriminalization billFormer President Juan Manuel Santos pulled the plug on aerial fumigation citing health concerns, but also after finding that Bogota and Washington DC had spent $22 billion on removing only 17,000 hectares of coca in a decade.According to diplomatic cables leaked by Wikileaks, Santos expressed his doubts about the bilateral counternarcotics strategy to former Under-Secretary of State Marc Grossman in 2004 already, but was told by US Ambassador William Wood the strategy “is working.”Santos was puzzled why the price of cocaine has not increased, despite the record-levels of aerial and manual eradication. Grossman observed that overall coca production went down in the Andean region by 15 percent. The Ambassador added that eradication is working.US EmbassyThe US government, which was initially hesitant about the effectiveness and cost of manual eradication was convinced by former President Alvaro Uribe to include the strategy in what was called “Plan Colombia II,” which sought and failed to reduce illegal armed groups’ hold on Colombia by cutting off illegal revenue from cocaine trafficking.Santos and counternarcotics experts, however, appear to have been running into  US officials’ persistent refusals to admit their strategy was a failure contrary to evidence as early as 2005.There has been a lot of discussion surrounding the recent release of the U.S. coca and poppy cultivation estimates in Washington, including the estimate that coca hectarage did not change significantly in 2004 in spite of record fumigation levels. In fact, although it would have been nice if the hectarage numbers had also gone down, last year, and every year for the last four years, the U.S. Colombian effort has had great success.Former US Ambassador William WoodFifteen years and $20 billion later, Santos has become one of the main critics of the US-led War on Drugs while both the White House and US Ambassador Philip Goldberg continue to push for the intensification of the costly, but useless counternarcotics strategy that is now also opposed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Drug policyPlan ColombiaUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-and-us-spent-20-billion-on-counternarcotics-despite-evidence-strategy-failed/,Colombia admits $22 billion US counternarcotics strategy failed
" The extradition of former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso to Colombia is increasingly unlikely after the foreign ministry admitted the government lied about filing an extradition request.Over the past weeks, Foreign Minister Claudia Blum and Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos went to great lengths to pretend they were seeking the Mancuso’s extradition from the US while they were not.Ceballos on Tuesday said that the foreign ministry had requested the extradition of the former AUC chief twice. The peace commissioner lied.Blum said on Wednesday that “the request for extradition will be formalized before the Department of State” if her department is able to translate 2,115 pages of legal documents before September 4.The State Department has indicated on that day would expel Mancuso to Italy, where the former AUC chief also has citizenship, as it apparently still hasn’t received a formal extradition request from Colombia where many are nervous the former AUC chief will get them in prison.“We have a narco-economy. We are a narco-scoiety,” Mancuso told the New York Times in 2008 as the demobilized AUC chief began revealing his ties with former President Alvaro Uribe’s criminal inner circle.Uribe extradited the AUC chief shortly after without the compulsory approval of the Supreme Court.Extradition requests are standard procedure, but according to Blum and Ceballos are more complicated than quantum physics in the case of the former AUC chief who has vowed to reveal the names of businessmen and state officials involved in crimes against humanity and drug trafficking.Among these alleges war criminals is Uribe, the boss of Blum and Ceballos, who will have to appear in court on September 16 about his alleged involvement in a 1997 massacre ordered by Mancuso.“Mancuso’s testimony could help uncover the truth about hundreds of crimes and ensure justice for thousands of victims,” Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, said Wednesday.His testimony could also mean prison for Uribe and countless other (former) state officials and businessmen, who couldn’t wait to get the former AUC chief to stop testifying after his demobilization in 2005.Mancuso has continued to operate with Colombian justice while he was in the US and has vowed he would continue to do so if he is expelled to Italy.

crimes against humanity, can only lose from the peace process.Assassinated social leadersSource: IndepazThe government’s complacency with terrorPresident Ivan Duque (Image: El Espectador)Duque and his party have made more effort trying to obstruct the peace process and undo the efforts of the 2011 Victims and Land Restitution Law that made the more than 9 million victims of the armed conflict visible.The government has been all but powerless in Congress and the courts to rewind the peace deal, but Duque’s failure to implement the peace deal and act against the terror imposed on those promoting peace process are just as effective.The president’s far-right party is as aggressive as ever against anyone challenging Duque while the president has reinstated “Uribista” policies like his “informants network,” which allegedly intimidates and criminalizes rural dissent.Only because of immense pressure from the international community, the government has reluctantly agreed to take part in a commission that seeks to formulate policies that would prevent terror by paramilitary structures closely associated to the ruling party and the military.The government since the beginning has made it clear to have no interest in a counternarcotics policy that would effectively reduce illicit crops that have long fueled armed conflict.The return of a land the size of Belgium that was dispossessed from small farmers under the leadership of Uribe has come to a half as well as the crop substitution program that sought a long-lasting solution for drug trafficking.Paramilitary groups associated with the government and ruling partyAguilas NegrasGaitanista Self-Defense Forces of ColombiaAnti-restitution armiesRastrojosLa ConstruEvidence of authorities’ complicity in terrorEvidence indicated far-right group Aguilas Negras is closely aligned with the security forces.Two years after taking office, the government and the National Army find themselves up to their neck in allegations they have been complicit in organized crime and crimes against humanity.Uribe was forced to leave the senate after the Supreme Court accused him of bribing witnesses to falsely accuse an opposition senator, Duque and his political patron are investigated over alleged election fraud, a court ordered an investigation into Interior Minister Nancy Patricia Gutierrez’s alleged ties to paramilitary groups and former Defense Minister Guillermo Botero was forced to resign for bombing victims of child recruitment.Throughout the country, military units and top army commanders have been accused of cooperating with drug trafficking groups and trying to terrorize and wiretap journalists trying to uncover this alleged criminal activity.Government officials have reportedly been taking part in political warfare campaigns against rival politicians, the war crimes tribunal and journalists.The National Police has been accused of embarking on a terror campaign in Bogota in November last year in an attempt to quell the country’s largest anti-government protests since the 1970’s.Social leaders complain they continue to suffer from stigmatization from government officials that in the past often was followed up by assassination attempts.Everybody in Colombia can guess who the Aguilas Negras are, except the Aguilas NegrasCan Duque end the terror?Whether Duque has the power to distance his government and the military from acts that terrorize the population is complicated by the fact that the president has no authority over his party or the military.Many in Colombia call the president a “puppet’ and evidence of spying by the National Army indicated that even Duque’s closest aides are being watched.In the case of the terror imposed by leftist ELN guerrillas and FARC dissidents, neither the government nor the security forces seem to have the capacity or the ability to protect civilians against these illegal armed groups.The situation is further complicated by US President Donald Trump, who on multiple occasions has dismissed Duque without empowering America’s staunchest ally to resist the criminal elements that have infiltrated the government and the security forces.This has allowed others in government and the security forces to promote criminal interest without Duque being able to resist these dissident forces that are undermining his government and security forces.The house arrest of Uribe, who was able to maintain some harmony within the ruling party and between the Democratic Center and the Duque administration have further weakened Duque’s control. armed conflictIvan Duqueterrorism ",https://colombiareports.com/how-president-ivan-duque-returned-the-terror-colombia-hoped-was-in-the-past/,How Duque revived the terror Colombia was hoping

" The dubious activity of the “honorable” family of TV anchor Maria Camila Orozco was part of Colombia’s cultural heritage before the journalist was even born.As if that wasn’t enough, the 29-year-old heir of the Caribbean dynasty spent much of her career spreading lies of former President Alvaro Uribe and his attorney, Jaime Granados.Lying will generally condemn a journalist to oblivion, but not Orozco; she became an anchor at national television network Caracol while local media are short of superlatives to praise the virtues of the family from the south of La Guajira.To speak of the Orozco family from Villanueva is to speak of their history and of the many great men this honorable family has given. To name them all would cover more than ten pages. But it is also good to highlight some who have honored the name of their native Villanueva.Hoy en NoticiaOrozco doing lip service for alleged mafiosi should not come as a surprise. She was brought up in a family whose alleged corruption became cultural heritage more than half a century ago.The legendary composer Rafael Escalona wrote about Enrique Orozco, who tried to use his political power to get contraband smuggler Tite Socarras out of trouble in the 1965 classic “El Almirante Padilla.”El Almirante Padilla (Rafael Escalona)Up there in La Guajira where contraband was bornThe Admiral Padilla got stuck near Puerto Lopez and left him ruinedPoor Tite, Poor Tite, Poor Tite SocarrasMan, he is really sad nowHe has lost everything for smugglingIf only Saint Thomas saw the bandit pirate shipHe promised to throw a party when turning over to a South Korean submarineLittle Enrique believed his patron Laureano would get a lot of things doneHe went to Bogota, but it was all in vainWhere will he go now?How will Tite Socarras make a living now?Where will he go now?Making a living without contraband?Pop singer Carlos Vives covered the song in 1991, but removed the not so flattering part about the Orozco family, which has held all kinds of political positions in La Guajira and the neighboring Cesar province.When singer Juan Piña recorded the song in 1977, the late Conservative Party mogul’s attempted corruption of former President Laureano Gomez was still very much a part of the story.Spinning Uribe’s liesJaime Granados (Image: Facebook)Thirty-one years after the hit, Orozco got her first job as a spokesperson for the Prosecutor General’s Office, which she somehow combined with studying journalism and public relations until she graduated in 2012.In early 2013, she began working for Uribe’s attorney, Jaime Granados, and immediately began spinning a web of lies on YouTube against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, one of the former Medellin Cartel associate’s fiercest critics.The conspiracy theories based on allegedly bribed witnesses had effect and the Supreme Court opened a criminal investigation in September 2014 into the claims that proved to be false in February 2018.From Uribe’s lawyer to Duque’s brother-inlawOrozco was hired by Blu Radio news chief Nestor Morales, the brother-in-law of President Ivan Duque, in March 2016 and “exclusively” reported that Uribe’s sons, Tomas and Jeronimo, claimed to be the victims of a conspiracy by “scrap metal czar” James Arias, which was a lie.The Uribe brothers’ scrap metal company Ecoinversiones was involved in a major tax evasion and fraud cartel that cost the former President’s sons a $1.4 million (COP5.4 billion pesos) fine and landed mastermind Garcia in prison.Orozco didn’t get sacked, but announced in April 2016 she would also be working for public television news program CM& as the judicial reporter for senior host Yamid Amat.This wasn’t much of a success as the senior journalist sacked her in March 2017.We are in the darkest hour of journalismMaria Camila OrozcoCarlos MattosA month after the Supreme Court announced criminal charges against Uribe in February 2018, Orozco went to Caracol, where she immediately began to cover trials against Granados’ clients.Initially she reported for both Caracol and Blu Radio on the case against the fugitive former Hyundai boss Carlos Mattos who appeared to be bribing multiple judges to prevent his extradition from Spain.In July 2019, sacked army Colonel Julio Cesar Ramirez told far-right website El Expediente that Orozco “always tried to help us and published” baseless corruption claims against former armed forces commander General Alberto Jose Mejia with the help of far-right El Tiempo columnist Salud Hernandez.The accusations were never proven and President Ivan Duque was forced to sack National Army chief Nicasio Martinez and more than a dozen other top army commanders for engaging in an unhinged political war against opponents of Uribe.Colombia’s mafia and the media | Part 2: Salud HernandezOrozco takes over reporting on UribeWhen the Supreme Court in August that year rejected all Granados’ requests to drop the charges against Uribe, the attorney’s’ former PR chief took over reporting on the her former employers’ case on both Blu Radio and Caracol Noticias.We have talked to the attorneys of former President Uribe who have said to disagree with the decision.Maria Camila OrozcoIn an October 2019 interview on Caracol with Uribe’s now-detained fixer, Diego Cadena, the journalist claimed that not Cadena, but Cepeda, had paid a witnesses, which the Supreme Court had already debunked.Why not add Uribe’s alleged election fraud?Former President Alvaro Uribe (L) and mafia associate Luis Guillermo Hernandez. (Image: Instagram)In early 2020, when the Supreme Court ordered an investigation against Uribe for allegedly conspiring with a drug trafficking organization to rig the 2020 elections, Orozco lied that the late money launderer was never suspected of any crime until after his murder in Brazil in May 2019.The journalist additionally coined the theory that Hernandez’s murder was ordered by the man whose son was allegedly assassinated by the Duque money laundering campaign financier.When the Supreme Court placed Uribe under house arrest earlier this month, Granados’ Orozco jumped in again to give her former boss’ what appeared an advertorial.The journalist who hadn’t interviewed the former president’s alleged victim once since she helped Uribe spin false claims, Orozco obediently allowed her former boss to claim that “what Senator Ivan Cepeda has said is a bunch of lies.”Duque’s brother-in-law did the rest of Granados’ lip service on Blu Radio also without hearing the alleged victim of the former president and former Medellin Cartel associate.

" President Ivan Duque has increasing trouble hosting his daily COVID-19 show as Colombia’s coronavirus outbreak has become the deadliest in the world.Duque on Saturday tried to compare fatality rates with those of countries where the disease peaked weeks earlier, but was interrupted by Health Minister Fernando Ruiz who said such a comparison made no sense.According to international data, Colombia had the highest number of deaths per million inhabitants over the past week, a little more than neighboring Peru, which registered a higher number of infections per million over the past week.A week before the end of the president’s national emergency, the virus reached a new record number of 400 daily deaths on Sunday amid what has been projected as the peak of the pandemic.Not counting untested fatalities, 17,314 have died of the pandemic on Sunday and 541,147 people, more than 1% of the population, has been infected by the coronavirus.Duque’s attempts to restart the economy against the advice to first control the spread of the virus is showing serious cracks despite the government’s barrage of false positives.As more doctors and nurses fall ill, the country’s healthcare system is close to collapsing under the weight of the pandemic as the president’s promised funds to reinforce the system never arrived.I do not understand which proper management of the pandemic they are celebrating, this is a humanitarian and public health tragedy that cannot be normalized.Colombian Medical Federation vice-president Carolina CorchoDuque doesn’t seem to want to face the tragedy caused by the pandemic and to a lesser extent his government’s ineptitude.The president repeated that 90% of manufacturing had restarting, ignoring the fact that exports and domestic consumption have collapsed.The president wouldn’t mention the public rage on social media over the weekend after it became public that the central bank sold off two thirds of the country’s gold reserves weeks before a price hike, potentially missing out on $1.4 billion.This pandemic has been a stress test that deepens the social, economic and cultural cracks that persist globally, and in a country as unequal as Colombia.Bioethicist Boris Julian PintoInviting education minister Maria Victoria Angulo on Sunday was no success either, three weeks after she flunked her strategy to reopen public schools on August 1, the minister was not able to report any progress.Schools will reopen “in due time,” according to Angulo.Colombia’s schools closed indefinitely after reopening plans flunkNot even the public participation element of Duque’s COVID show worked as a citizen told the president how his Friday plan to open bars and clubs without liquor sales made no sense, considering this is their income.The comments on Facebook showed Colombians’ despair over Duque’s failing government.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque said Thursday that Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro is seeking to buy middle and long-range missiles through Iran.Citing “international intelligence agencies,” Duque claimed that “the information that exists is that they have not yet arrived but that they have been seeking contact.”We have longstanding but also confirmed intelligence information that members of the Venezuelan Guard are seeking weapons from other countries, particularly from Russia and Belarus… Fortunately we have the capacity to know and condemn.President Ivan DuqueThe president made the claim days after meeting with the national security adviser of US President Donald Trump, Robert C. O’Brien, and other top officials from Washington DC.Venezuela’s alleged interest in missiles would be linked to the mass killing of human rights defenders in Colombia, according to Duque, who has been criticized for failing to implement domestic peace policies that would diminish this violence.The Trump and Duque administrations have been at odds with the authoritarian Maduro administration since they took office respectively in 2016 and 2018.Previous claims that Venezuela’s government would be having ties with leftist ELN guerrillas and FARC dissidents backfired when Duque was called out for presenting fabricated evidence to the United Nations General Assembly.Joint attempts to oust Maduro have also failed and effectively solidified the position of Venezuela’s socialist government, which can count on the support of Russia and China.

" Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe renounced his senate seat in the hope this will convince the Supreme Court to transfer his case to the notoriously corrupt prosecution.In a letter to Senate President Arturo Char, Uribe formally requested his resignation for a second time, this time claiming the Supreme Court is violating his right to a fair trial.The Supreme Court placed the former president under house arrest and suspended him from the senate earlier this month while entering the final phase of Uribe’s fraud and bribery trial.With his resignation, the former president forces the Supreme Court to decide whether to continue investigating Uribe or transfer his case to the notoriously corrupt Prosecutor General’s Office.Under Colombian law, the prosecution is the designated body to prosecute an alleged criminal, unless the alleged crimes were committed by a “privileged” suspect such as governors or congressmen like Uribe.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonThe Supreme Court may decide to transfer the case if it finds that the crimes allegedly committed by Uribe are unrelated to his privilege.Uribe’s move is unique as no other alleged criminal has ever renounced from the senate on claims the Supreme Court was politically biased.The former president’s resignation was accepted by the senate in an 82 to 12 vote in which the opponents reminded Uribe revoked his resignation once before on claims that “the accusations about witnesses made against me are based on events that happened while I was a senator, which maintains the competence of the Court.”The Supreme Court opened an investigation against the former president and leader of the ruling Democratic Center party in 2018 for allegedly tampering witnesses to sustain false charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda in 2014.In a debate, Cepeda had shown video of former fighters of paramilitary group Bloque Metro testifying that Uribe and his brother had co-founded a paramilitary group when Uribe was governor of the Antioquia province in the 1990’s.Why Colombia’s former president is accused of forming bloodthirsty death squadsIf the Supreme Court decides to keep the case, it could decide to investigate these far more serious claims made by the witnesses Uribe allies allegedly tried to intimidate.

" Colombia’s Supreme Court rejected requests to release former President Alvaro Uribe on Wednesday as his alleged victim claimed he was being shadowed and receiving death threats.Supporter of the far-right former president demanded his immediate release, claiming that Uribe’s resignation as senator made his fraud and bribery trial removed the Supreme Court’s authority to investigate him.The Supreme Court said it had rejected the 177 writs and denied the former president’s rights were being violated.The court is studying a request by Uribe’s attorney, Jaime Granados, to transfer his case to the notoriously corrupt prosecution.Opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda said Wednesday he was being shadowed and had received an increased number of death threats.Uribe’s trial followed the former president alleged bribery of witnesses to file false criminal charges against Cepeda after the opposition senator released testimonies of paramilitaries claiming the former president co-founded a paramilitary group in the 1990’s.Cepeda on Tuesday asked the Inspector General’s Office to investigate top government officials for taking part in attempts to discredit the court led by Uribe’s far-right political party, the Democratic Center.Uribe’s house arrest and subsequent resignation from the senate deprived the party of President Ivan Duque of its undisputed leader.The United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Diego Garcia, said Tuesday that he was monitoring the “state of institutionality” in Colombia.Judicial independence and the separation of powers, essential principles of democracy and the rule of law, include respect for the decisions of the Supreme Court.

" This week’s ballyhooed joint announcement by Colombia and the US of a big investment package to support rural development was so empty of detail it amounted to nothing more than a PR offensive to prop up the beleaguered presidents of both countries.President Ivan Duque and senior US officials made the announcement together in Bogota of the new Colombia Growth project that offered lofty goals for unspecified actions at unspecified times.Duque said the new initiative will “provide resources for community development… We welcome it with joy because it fits perfectly into our strategy to reenergize Colombia with a commitment to infrastructure development.”US National Security Advisor Robert C. O’Brien said it “will harness a wide variety of agencies across the United States Government to expand our efforts focused on rural development, infrastructure expansion, security, and the rule of law.”Adam Boehler, CEO of the US International Development Finance Corp. (DFC), said, “President Duque and I are committed to constructing a comprehensive, multibillion-dollar investment plan that focuses on providing economic opportunity to the Colombian people, particularly farmers.”Nobody said what the program would actually do. Everything was couched in terms of “plans” and “potential.”Duque said that at some currently unscheduled future meeting officials will “fine-tune details with concrete objectives.”Nevertheless, despite the apparent absence of any specifics, Duque said the project would become “a kind of model of what development cooperation in the 21st century in the Americas should be.”If the US Development Finance Corp. were ever to make investments that actually benefit rural farmers, it would require a 180-degree turn from the kind of investments it currently supports in Colombia.For example, its web site lists three 2019 projects in Colombia. One involved a $7.75 million contract to a Tulsa, Oklahoma, company working on 15 new oil wells in the Palagua Field, 180 kilometers northwest of Bogota. A second was $3.0 million to a Bogota-based firm for work on the same oil well project.The third 2019 project was a loan guarantee for a $350 million improvement and maintenance package for the 193-kilometer Puerta de Hierro toll road, which connects seaports and airports across a section of the northern Caribbean coast.Both Duque and his US counterpart, President Donald Trump, have motivation to seek happy headlines. Duque’s administration is facing a mismanaged COVID pandemic, ongoing slaughters of civilians in rural areas, weekly exposures of new high-level government scandals, and record high cocaine trafficking.And both Duque and Trump are facing for the first time a large group of members of the US Congress who are concerned about the deteriorating situation in Colombia and the weak US support for full implementation of the peace agreement with the FARC.A July letter to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was signed by 94 members of Congress, following a similar letter in May with 79 signatures. Among other things, the letters sought a “unified and unifying message that the United States supports full implementation of the 2016 peace accord.” United States ",https://colombiareports.com/columbia-and-us-talk-big-but-offer-no-specifics-in-announcing-rural-development-plan/,Colombia and US talk big but offer no specifics in announcing rural development plan

He has lost actions against me before all bodies (Supreme Court, Inspector General and State Council).Senator Ivan CepedaThe opposition senator additionally said he will inquire about the prosecution’s progress in criminal investigations against those who allegedly conspired with Uribe to bribe witnesses.Alvaro Uribe’s anticlimactic political deathIn the interview with controversial Semana columnist Vicky Davila and El Tiempo columnist Maria Isabel Rueda, Uribe repeated false claims the opposition senator bribed witnesses, this time with the Supreme Court’s “complicity.”The Supreme Court found Uribe’s 2014 claims that the opposition senator was bribing witnesses false in a 2018 ruling in which the court announced it would investigated Uribe for allegedly bribing witnesses.The criminal investigation led to evidence indicating the former president stepped up his alleged bribery practices to defend himself against the fraud and bribery charges.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonCepeda refrained from taking legal action against Uribe until after the Semana interview in which the former president coined countless conspiracy theories.Until Monday, the former president seemed to be perfectly capable of getting himself in legal trouble without the help of the opposition senator who revealed the testimonies of demobilized paramilitaries who claimed Uribe and his brother founded a paramilitary death squad in the 1990’s.

" Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe wasn’t even granted a grandiose exit from politics, the Supreme Court simply left him for dead.The country’s most important politician and alleged fraudster could have gone out with a bang, being charged with being complicit in massacres, the murder of a human rights defender or even the foundation of a terrorist organization.But of all the 84 criminal investigations against Uribe, the court placed inmate #1087985 under house arrest on fraud and bribery charges as if the former Medellin Cartel associate and key person of the country’s most bloodthirsty paramilitary group was a petty criminal.Journalist Vicky Davila of weekly Semana and El Tiempo columnist Maria Isabel Rueda tried to resuscitate the former president on Sunday, announcing that “Uribe talks from his detention for the first time.”The double interview felt like a funeral after Davila, who married int one of Colombia’s most notorious crime families, looked at the number of viewers and seemed to realize the interview was the last.The interview began normal with Uribe accusing the court of being “politically biased” and the Semana columnist counting “we have 100,000 viewers.”The interview couldn’t have ended more awkward, though. Not even after two hours of incoherent conspiracy theories either Rueda or Davila seemed to want to end their final moment with their favorite crime suspect.“I recommend moringa,” said Uribe when asked for a cure against COVID-19. “if it doesn’t help it doesn’t hurt either,” the former president added.Uribe’s quackery solutions against the pandemic that killed 15,000 Colombians to date seemed a  hint that the interview wasn’t going to go anywhere.“If there were one final word you would want to be remembered for, what would it be?” asked Davila.“Straight-forward,” said Uribe before he was cut short while embarking on a tirade over Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez.Uribe wasn’t ready to utter his final words, but there was nothing more to say or do.Estranged from his political allies and supported by only a few thousand hardcore followers, Uribe is politically dead, whether he accepts it or not.

" A mid-term poll about who Colombians would vote for if the 2022 elections were held today showed that leftist and centrist peace advocates have marginalized President Ivan Duque’s far-right allies.According to pollster Ivanmer, the runner-up in the 2018 elections, progressive Senator Gustavo Petro is with 32.9% by far Colombia’s favorite to succeed the unpopular president.Peace advocates dominate the fieldGustavo Petro (Image: Richard McColl)The outspoken critic of Duque is followed by the centrist Sergio Fajardo, a former Mayor of Medellin, who was seen favorably by 19.9%Third is Liberal Party politician Humberto de la Calle, the former Vice-President who successfully negotiated peace with the Marxist FARC guerrillas between 2012 and 2016 would be elected president by 12.1% of those polled by Invamer.The three are all members of peace movement Defendamos la Paz, which has been promoting the implementation of peace policies opposed by the president and his far-right Democratic Center party.Mid-term presidential pollSource: InvamerRight-wing candidates marginalizedMarta Lucia RamirezDuque’s broad disapproval rating, ongoing corruption and mismanagement scandals, and last week’s house arrest of the president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, have marginalized the the far-right ruling party.The most popular of the potential government candidate is the first female  Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez, who can count on the support of 11.4% of voters.She is followed by former Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez, who rose to power at home with the support of Fajardo, but has shifted to the right while in office.Alejandro Char (Radical Change), the former mayor of Barranquilla and a leader of the notoriously corrupt Char Clan, can count on the support of 7% of people polled by Invamer.Senator Jorge Robledo, a staunch leftist with a loyal following, can count on 4.3% of the votes and Rafel Nieto, one of the far-right ideologues of Duque’s party can count on the support of 1.3% of the votes.The Uribista implosionAlvaro Uribe interrogated by Supreme Court magistrate Cesar ReyesTwo years after Duque took office, the president has virtually destroyed his own party, which wasn’t formed until 2013.The party received a major electoral beating in October last year, which left all major cities in the hands of progressive mayors who want nothing to do with the authoritarian tendencies of the president and his allegedly criminal political patron.Until the coronavirus, Duque’s first two years in office were marred by his party’s abuses of power, resistance against the increasingly popular peace process and general misrule.The government’s handling of the coronavirus has further diminished governability as local and regional authorities have taken the lead in dealing with the crisis while Duque spends most his time experimenting with propaganda on Facebook.With Uribe, the founder and undisputed leader of the ruling party under house arrest, both the government and the party have become all but rudderless, which would complicate their comeback before the 2022 elections. 2022 electionselection polls ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-2022-election-poll-peace-advocates-marginalize-duque-allies/,Colombia 2022 election poll: peace advocates marginalize Duque allies

" US Vice-President Mike Pence foolishly believes a mafioso with one foot in prison is a hero in Colombia, presumably because he never heard of these brilliant minds the country has fostered.Alvaro GomezAlvaro Gomez was a dynasty politician, jurist and journalist with an intellect and moral integrity only few in politics are blessed with.Born the son of former President Laureano Gomez, known as “The Monster” by liberals, Gomez was a man of contradictions.The founder of the Sergio Arboleda University opposed what he called “the regime” of corrupt nepotists and sought a “national salvation” through social conservative policies with zero tolerance for corruption.Gomez was one of the three main authors of Colombia’s 1991 constitution and ran for president three times, but was assassinated in 1995 before he could fulfill his dream. Gomez’s murder was never solved.Jaime GarzonJaime Garzon was a journalist, peace advocate and arguably the funniest guy in the history of Colombia.He was shot dead by assassins of the Medellin mafia at the order of paramilitary commander Carlos Castaño presumably because former intelligence official Jose Miguel Narvaez thought Garzon’s sense of humor was a threat.The news of Garzon’s death was such a shock that even the evening news concluded Colombia was a “shithole country” where even being too funny could get you killed.Alvaro CamachoAlvaro Camacho was a sociologist who had Colombia’s social and political ills figured out before they even became an issue.Camacho argued that the root problem of Colombia’s state was that it sought to violently impose authority without addressing its root problem; the lack of legitimacy caused by corruption and incompetence.The sociologist warned that drug trafficking would only aggravate this problem as organized crime would provide the state with a justification to impose authority even more violently while corrupting the state to the point of losing all legitimacy.Camacho coined this theory in 1988 after which Colombia’s subsequent governments did exactly the opposite, which almost led to a failed state in the late 1990s.The professor died in 2011.Luis Carlos GalanLuis Carlos Galan was an anti-corruption advocate and widely projected to become the president in 1990 had it not been for a rival Liberal Party politician who was friends with late drug lord Pablo Escobar who ordered him dead in 1989.Galan’s opposition to corruption, and drug trafficking in specific, made him a popular hero with enemies both in politics and the mafia who had nothing to gain from a functional democracy.The liberal politician’s death served its purpose and, opposite to Galan’s wishes, the country’s governments spiraled into an increasingly corrupt and authoritarian state that was opposed by increasingly violent and corrupt insurgencies.Ivan VelasquezIvan Velasquez is arguably Latin America’s most powerful anti-corruption warrior who is both feared and loathed by the corrupt in Colombia and Guatemala.Ironically, Velasquez studied law with former President Alvaro Uribe in Medellin after which Velasquez went into law enforcement and Uribe got into politics under the wing of the Medellin Cartel.After spending the first decade of the century as an auxiliary Supreme Court magistrate, Velasquez had imprisoned more than 50 congressmen and had given his former classmate a one-way ticket to prison.Having made countless enemies at home, the jurist was appointed United Nations Commissioner of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, which got former President Jimmy Morales so nervous he gave Velasquez and his team 48 hours to leave the country in 2019.  culture ",https://colombiareports.com/the-brilliant-minds-colombia-fostered-and-mike-pence-probably-never-heard-of/,The brilliant minds Colombia fostered and Mike Pence probably never heard of
" Colombia’s mass media played a key role in a 2002 terror campaign that sought to get former President Alvaro Uribe elected and the obstruction of justice to keep him out of prison.This worked for a while as the media prioritize “the interests of the mafia and the plutocracy” instead of the public, according to the Autonomous University in Cali.Despite the effort, Uribe is close to joining many of his former allies in prison as the Supreme Court is investigating the alleged fraud and bribery practices of the former Medellin Cartel associate.Electoral terrorismAhead of the elections, Medellin newspaper El Colombiano focused almost exclusively on guerrilla violence.The earliest evidence Uribe was using mass media for a terror campaign dates back to the 2002 election campaign when media falsely blamed FARC guerrillas for five terrorist attacks in Bogota carried out by the National Army.A fabricated assassination attempt on Uribe in the northern city of Barranquilla that cost the lives of five civilians one month before the elections was carried out by now-defunct intelligence agency DAS, but was also attributed to the FARC.Although it is not yet known precisely who is behind this attack, everything seems to indicate that it would be the urban militias of the FARC, which in recent months have acted in different cities of the country.El PaisA judge convicted multiple members of the military for the Bogota bomb attacks in 2006, but only weekly Semana reported on this.Curiously, the same magazine revived the Barranquilla hoax in 2008 based on fabricated evidence on an alleged FARC computer.There is no evidence aforementioned media were complicit in the 2002 terror campaign; the newspapers just didn’t verify authorities’ claims.Only television network RCN and its sister companies openly supported the paramilitaries who helped the former president win the elections after the US government designated paramilitary organization AUC a foreign terrorist organization in 2001.War propagandaEl Colombiano reported locals “applauded” a 2002 military operation that consolidated the power of Medellin crime lord “Don Berna.”Immediately after Uribe’s election, AUC founder Carlos Castaño went on a PR campaign with the help of El Tiempo columnist Salud Hernandez who wrote the prologue of his book, RCN host Claudia Gurisatti who did two lengthy interviews with the mass murderer in 2002 and 2003, and El Espectador columnist Ernesto Yamhure who managed Castaño’s PR.El Espectador columnist Felipe Zuleta argued that news media should “embed” themselves in the government policy and censor themselves particularly when it came to “annihilating” criminal elements.We journalists… must begin by assuming that either this war is won by the Colombian state, even with certain restrictions on the press, or we all lose; in which case we will no longer have a country, or fundamental rights, or freedom of the press, or anything else.El Espectador columnist Felipe ZuletaEl Tiempo in 2003 stressed the necessity for “psy-ops,” that seek to submit civilians to military rule while the paramilitaries were still fighting alongside the National Army.Arauca proves that ‘psychological operations’ are not enough to win popular collaboration, which is indispensable in the fight against an enemy whose power people fear more than that of an absent state. Reducing the country’s problems to the lack of police and military security is wrong. A second element, which is decisive and little debated, is the restructuring and modernization of the armed forces. Progress has been made in recent years, but much remains to be doneEl TiempoIn a news article that year, El Tiempo reported that while Uribe “didn’t get the donors to go for the wallet, he was able to neutralize the NGOs critical of his management” that included the mass killing of civilians media were reporting as military victories.The president failed to demobilize the paramilitaries as Uribe’s term came to an end in 2006, but was able to bribe two congressmen to allowed Uribe a second reelection bid.Power through manipulation: The story of the Santos familyOperation AmazonasThe DAS sought to rig the elections with “Operation Amazonas,” which sought to “promote actions to benefit the state for the 2006 elections.”This 2005 operation included the intimidation of the Constitutional Court, which had to approve Uribe a second election run and smear campaigns against Uribe’s opponents, according to leaked DAS documents.Amazonas was one of a number of intelligence operations, of which at least three were carried out with Hernandez, her friend Vicky Davila and a relatively obscure journalist called Jesus Antonio Villamizar.These operations received the support of drug trafficker Juan Carlos Sierra, a.k.a. “El Tuso,” a friend of Uribe’s cousin Mario.Colombia’s leading weekly conspires with narco to discredit Supreme CourtMedia-endorsed terrorismThe US military contributed to the mass hysteria claiming Al Qaeda was providing missiles to the FARC.El Tiempo, which was owned by the family of former President Juan Manuel Santos, fully supported the former president’s 2006 reelection bid, claiming Uribe was “the leader who… to us would seem the best qualified to govern us in the next four years.”Two months after this editorial, former minister German Vargas survived a car bomb attack the newspaper’s website attributed to the FARC within half an hour.Davila accused Santos of this attack in her 2014 book “Enemies,” much to the fury of Vargas who said the DAS tried to kill him.Medellin newspaper El Colombiano, which has idolized fascist and nazi leaders since the 1930’s, stepped up their slander and stigmatization practices, focusing mainly on Uribe critics and peace advocates.After former Interior Minister Fernando Londoño claimed that “San Jose de Apartado is a FARC enclave where they rule at will” in a 2005 column, paramilitaries carried out a massacre and El Colombiano owner Ana Mercedes Gomez was accused of taking part in a “criminal strategy.”Semana changed course after the 2006 elections and began reporting on Uribe’s criminal practices, making the weekly a target of aggression.Manufacturing fascism: The story of Colombia’s Gomez familyMedia help Uribe fake charges against Supreme CourtWhen she was director of radio station La FM in 2007, Davila apparently conspired with the DAS to interview demobilized paramilitary fighter “Tasmania” in 2007 in order to forge a criminal investigation against former Supreme Court magistrate Ivan Velasquez during her news program on La FM.The conspiracy was in response to the magistrate’s investigation of El Tuso’s friend and Uribe’s cousin Mario, according to imprisoned former DAS executive Martha Leal, who was involved in the plot.The narco allegedly paid Tasmania to incriminate Velasquez in a conspiracy made up by the DAS and at least one of Uribe’s closest aides, Edmundo Castillo, who is also in prison.Hernandez falsely accused Supreme Court magistrate Ascensio Reyes of having ties to an Italian drug trafficker in a number of articles in newspaper El Tiempo that were part of the DAS’ “Operation Paseo” in 2008, according to Leal and another imprisoned former DAS executive, Jorge Lagos.This theory was also promoted by Interior Minister Nancy Patricia Gutierrez, who was senator at the time and also using fabricated DAS information to falsely accuse former Senator Piedad Cordoba (Liberal Party) of being a FARC ally.El Tuso admitted in 2011 that he also worked with the DAS to coerce photographer Jesus Antonio Villamizar to falsely claim he had images of House Representative Yidis Medina with the ELN after the lawmaker admitted she made the reelection bribe public in 2008.Three foreign journalists were expelled from the country while covering a sugarcane cutter strike on claims they were FARC sympathizers as anyone opposing Uribe was facing increasingly fierce aggression.How Colombia’s newspapers consistently misinformed the public on the armed conflictThe “false witness cartels”Imprisoned former Senator Hernan Andrade, who was the Conservative Party chief at the time, coined the term “False Witnesses Cartel” for the first time, exactly when evidence indicated the opposite.Meanwhile, the former president, his far-right allies and the media continued their unhinged attacks on any critic, peace advocate or human rights defender.Independent journalist Hollman Morris was “promoting terrorism,” Uribe said in 2009.“Cordoba would already have been tried and convicted for high treason” in a “normal country,” former Vice-Minister of Defense Luis Guillermo Velez said in a column on political news website La Silla Vacia.The then-senator had just been nominated for a Nobel Peace prize and Morris’ film “Impunity” was revealing how the demobilization of paramilitary organization AUC had been a hoax. Both were forced to leave the country due to death threats.After Uribe left office in 2010, El Tiempo aligned with the former president’s successor, Santos, whose family had sold the paper in 2007.This left only RCN, and regional newspapers like El Colombiano and La Patria to promote the former president’s far-right agenda.After Santos approved the 2011 Victims and Land restitution bill that sought to compensate the more than 7 million victims and return land the size of Belgium that was stolen by Uribe and his allies, regional media like La Patria and El Colombiano stepped up the stigmatization of social leaders defending victims’ rights.With only the help of the regional media, the former president retook opposition to the Victims Law and a peace process with the FARC that had begun in 2012 from Congress in 2014.“The False Testimony”The former president filed criminal charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, claiming that Uribe’s alleged ties to the paramilitaries were made up by a “false witness cartel.”Gustavo Moreno, a defense attorney close to the former president, published a book called “The False Testimony” in 2015 and was appointed the prosecution’s anti-corruption chief in 2016.Moreno was arrested and extradited to the United States in 2017 for mediating bribes between investigated congressmen and Supreme Court magistrates.The Supreme Court absolved Cepeda in 2018 and announced it would investigate Uribe for bribing witnesses to file fraudulent charges.After Uribe’s puppet Ivan Duque was elected president in August that year, El Tiempo and Semana rallied behind the government again.Semana hired Davila and Hernandez who resumed stigmatizing critics and smearing the Supreme Court, but to no avail as the media are in crisis.Uribe is under house arrest and with one foot in prison. The former president’s survivors have all been absolved.El Tuso is better off than anyone; the convicted narco has been living in the US since finding out that even compulsive liars can get government protection if they “cooperate with justice.” Alvaro Uribearmed conflictjournalism ",https://colombiareports.com/how-colombias-mass-media-terrorized-people-into-voting-for-mike-pences-hero/,How Colombia’s mass media helped terrorize people into voting for Uribe
" The former leader of Colombia’s AUC paramilitaries knows exactly which politicians and security officials are trying to get away with murder, like the country’s ambassador to Washington DC.Human Rights Watch Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco explained already that bungling the extradition of Salvatore Mancuso would be a “slap in the face of victims” and “guarantee impunity.”The entire purpose of demobilizing the paramilitaries and extraditing Mancuso may have been to grant impunity as, according to the former rancher, he took up arms in 1989 and knows exactly which politicians, businesses, ranchers and members of the military collaborated with the paramilitaries without doing time.How to steal land the size of a small country | Part V: the Medellin eliteMancuso’s explosive paramilitary mightMancuso founded the Horizonte Ltda. which was formally dedicated to “the retail of a variety of products, mainly beverages and tobacco while providing community participation and security” in Tierralta, Cordoba, in 1995, but was really part of the illegal ACCU paramilitary group formed by the Castaño family and Medellin crime lord “Don Berna.”In 1997, Mancuso founded Guaymaral Ltda with Jorge Gnecco, the late brother-in-law of journalist Vicky Davila, who spent most his life trafficking drugs.Mancuso additionally founded the Catatumbo Bloc and the Montes de Maria Bloc, laying the foundation of what would later become the almighty Northern Bloc that gave political “clans” and drug traffickers almost absolute control over the Caribbean region.Demobilizing only the armed wingBetween 2003 and 2006, Mancuso and “Jorge 40,”  demobilized more than 4,600 armed fighters, the armed wing of a paramilitary apparatus that controlled the political and economic systems.The Northern Bloc’s paramilitary rule left some 600 innocent civilians dead and more than 900 families displaced and hundreds of businessmen, military officials and politicians pretending they hadn’t done anything,One of them, ironically, is Colombia’s ambassador to Washington DC, Francisco Santos, who asked the paramilitary to form a similar paramilitary apparatus in the capital Bogota, according to Mancuso.Santos has admitted meeting with the paramilitary leader, but claimed this was merely out of a journalistic interest as he was editor-in-chief of newspaper El Tiempo at the time.Foreign Minister Claudia Blum, who founded the Radical Change party in 1998, saw half her party go to prison between 2006 and 2010 because of their ties to the AUC.Mancuso has also said he will say everything he knows about former President Alvaro Uribe and his brother Santiago, who were already neck-deep in paramilitary trouble without the senior AUC chief.Unless the administration of President Ivan Duque gets its papers in order, the US government will send Mancuso, who has double nationality, to Italy.Whether the Northern Bloc’s victims or the International Criminal Court will accept another evasion of justice is a risky gamble. armed conflictAUCCordobapeace processSalvatore Mancuso ",https://colombiareports.com/why-former-paramilitary-leader-is-making-people-in-colombia-uneasy/,Why former paramilitary leader is making people in Colombia uneasy

" US authorities plan to send former paramilitary chief Salvatore Mancuso to Italy after Colombia’s government apparently dropped an extradition request, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday.The demobilized AUC chief, who has double nationality, was supposed to be extradited to Colombia after his release from prison on March 27, but sources close to Mancuso told the American news agency that the Department of Homeland Security ordered his removal to Italy on April 16.The return of Salvatore Mancuso, the man who demobilized Colombia’s paramilitariesExtradition request surprisingly revokedFrancisco SantosAccording to AP, Colombia’s Foreign Ministry surprisingly revoked a pending extradition request last month while concerns over the former AUC leader’s physical and judicial security in Colombia grew.This surprise move reportedly allowed Mancuso’s attorney in the US, Joaquin Perez, to outmaneuver prosecutors seeking the extradition of the former AUC chief to Colombia.“You have to be really naive to believe that an involuntary bureaucratic mistake is what is blocking the return of the person who knows the most about the history of the paramilitaries,” AP quoted opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda as saying.Colombia’s ambassador to Washington DC, Fancisco Santos, has reportedly tried to block the transfer to Italy of the man who accuses him of seeking the formation of a paramilitary group in the capital Bogota in 1997.Former paramilitary chiefs threaten reputation of many “good Colombians”“I have no doubt they will kill him”“Mancuso wants to return to Colombia. But it’s us, his lawyers and friends, and even some authorities, who have told him not to come back,” Mancuso’s attorney in Colombia, Jaime Paeres, told AP.“I have no doubt they will kill him if he comes,” said the attorney who recently claimed that 35 armed men were looking for him while on a farm just outside MedellinEver since the transitional Justice and Peace tribunal paroled Mancuso in November last year, prosecutors and judges have tried to overturn this ruling, demanding his arrest on return.The AUC leader reiterated his willingness to cooperate with the peace process in a phone call with demobilized guerrilla leader Rodrigo Londoño, a.k.a. “Timochenko,” last month.Mancuso’s cooperation with justice, however, is what got former President Alvaro Uribe to extradite him without warrant in 2008, according to the former AUC chief.“With me they extradited the truth,” Mancuso told press then.

" Colombia’s most influential weekly, Semana, on Thursday facilitated pundit Vicky Davila conspiring with convicted drug trafficker “El Tuso” to discredit the Supreme Court for the second time.Davila, a member of the notorious Gnecco crime family, took part in a failed conspiracy to discredit the Supreme Court allegedly with the help of Juan Carlos Sierra, a.k.a. “El Tuso,” in 2007.The pundit was heard over her role in the criminal conspiracy, but never investigated. The convicted narco said Thursday he was never heard about the conspiracy despite a 2013 court order to investigate him.The notoriously criminal in-laws of one of Colombia’s most famous journalistsThe journalist serving criminal interests“El Tuso”Davila’s interview with the convicted narco was almost the same as the one she did with “Tasmania,” a former paramilitary, who was bribed as part of a criminal conspiracy to smear the Supreme Court.At the time, the court was investigating former Senator Mario Uribe, the cousin of former President Alvaro Uribe and El Tuso’s childhood friend.This time, the Supreme Court is investigating the former president for bribing witnesses like Tasmania, who failed to hear the convicted narco who allegedly bribed the false witness in 2007.To prevent criminal charges like the ones that sent Tasmania, Uribe’s former judicial secretary and a top intelligence official to prison, El Tuso was assisted by his lawyer, Manuel Retureta.Exactly like Tasmania, the former narco had prepared himself for the interview with Davila and was reading claims from paper.Colombia’s mafia and the media | Part 1: Vicky DavilaDiscrediting the court without legal troubleAlvaro Uribe interrogated by Supreme Court magistrate Cesar ReyesThe pundit and El Tuso did their best to discredit the Supreme Court and imply Uribe was the victim of a conspiracy, but couldn’t get very far without committing a crime.Semana called the convicted narco’s testimony “a fundamental piece” even though El Tuso said nothing new.The narco confirmed that Senator Ivan Cepeda and former Senator Piedad Cordoba visited him in prison in 2009 and claimed they offered political asylum for his family if he would cooperate with justice.Retureta said he was present at the meeting, but stressed that “it didn’t get to the point they said ‘we want you to say this so we give you something.”When Davila asked El Tuso why the Supreme Court hadn’t heard him, the former narco said he told the prosecution he wasn’t available.El Tuso added that he was afraid to testify, because “all who testified found themselves investigated” and he has been able to evade justice over the 2007 conspiracy so far.Prostituting journalism“Tasmania”Despite playing a key role in the smearing of Supreme Court magistrate Ivan Velasquez with the use of bribed witnesses, Davila was never investigated while even Uribe’s personal secretary went to prison.El Tuso, who told the pundit he was never heard, also played a key role, according to Tasmania and Sergio Gonzalez, who got the former paramilitary involved in the conspiracy after Tasmania asked the narco to help him receive judicial benefits.Gonzalez told the court he subsequently met with Uribe’s cousin and the former president’s brother Santiago.After coordinating matters with Martha Leal, an executive of now-defunct intelligence agency DAS, the attorney told Tasmania he would be transferred, receive 400 million pesos and a house for his mother if he agreed to falsely accuse Supreme Court magistrate Ivan Velasquez of trying to bribe him.Gonzalez said he wrote the letter in which the former paramilitary falsely accused the magistrate and sent it to the president’s office on September 11, 2007.Tasmania was transferred three weeks later and gave money he had received from El Tuso to the former paramilitary’s mother.Gonzalez and El Tuso prepared the demobilized paramilitary and gave him the written answers for the interview with Davila on radio station La FM on October 6.The pundit told investigators she agreed “to do a rehearsal of his story before I started with the questions, that’s how it was done and that’s what you hear in the interview.”Davila told the investigators initially she took the initiative to call Tasmania and that the contact who had given her the information was confidential.Two days after the interview, Uribe demanded a criminal investigation into the false claims that had been invented by his administrative secretary Edmundo del Castillo and now-defunct intelligence agency DAS.

" Colombia’s Inspector General’s Office has raised concerns about police plans to buy cyber surveillance equipment that would provide access to social media accounts and messaging services like Whatsapp, newspaper El Tiempo reported Thursday.The National Police’s intelligence unit DIPOL opened a $1.2 million (COP4.5 billion) bid for technology companies that provide this type of spying services last month, according to the newspaper.The police reportedly said it is looking for digital surveillance software to improve citizen security through “following media tendencies and social media.”Specifically, the police said it will use public information that is voluntarily shared by users in their social media profiles,  like followers, comments, interactions, locations and hashtags.According to DIPOL, another purpose is to be on alert for Google searches related to child pornography, arms trafficking, drugs, banking crime, among others.This is too vague, according to the Inspector General’s Office, which wants DIPOL to specifically indicate what legal standards will be applied to crawl the internet, who will have access to the information and how citizens’ privacy will be guaranteed.Criminal law expert Jacques Simhon told the newspaper that there should be legal limits also on the crawling of public information.From a law enforcement point of view, this is legal; but it must be clear who is keeping the information not used for prosecution and for what purpose.Criminal law expert Jacques SimhonMultiple scandals involving authorities abusing surveillance equipment have sunk public confidence in the authorities’ respect for privacy and the legal use of equipment wanted by Police Intelligence.Last year, the Council of State found a former DIPOL commander Guillermo Julio Chavez guilty of illegally wiretapping demobilized paramilitaries.Journalists Claudia Morales, Jairo Lozano and Vicky Davila were warned in 2015 they were targets of surveillance and interceptions by DIPOL to protect General Rodolfo Palomino, who was involved in a prostitution scandal.Now-defunct intelligence agency DAS was caught wiretapping state officials, magistrates, journalists, and opposition leaders.Former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez has been accused of using prosecution wiretapping equipment for all kinds of reasons.Weekly Semana revealed earlier this year that the National Army was unlawfully wiretapping and profiling state officials, magistrates, journalists, and opposition leaders.The police has until August 18 to answer the Inspector General’s questions, according to El Tiempo.

" A last-minute decision by Medellin’s mayor to sue allegedly corrupt contractors of public utilities company EPM triggered the resignation of its board of directors.Mayor Daniel Quintero said on Tuesday that EPM would sue private contractors for $2.6 billion over losses generated by corruption in the construction of Colombia’s largest hydro-electric dam, HidroItuango.Quintero told television network Caracol on Wednesday that he had taken this decision unilaterally because the board refused to seek compensation, which would leave the corruption cost of the controversial project to the residents of Medellin.In their resignation letter, the board members said they were never consulted about possible legal action, and that the mayor and CEO Alvaro Guillermo Rendon sought to change the business model of the public utilities company without their consent.Beyond the specific explanations that can be given to these facts, we are concerned that the good practices of Corporate Governance that have characterized the EPM Business Group are not being observed.Former EPM board of directorsThe crisis at EPM follows tensions between the public utilities company and the mayor, who was one of the public utilities’ fiercest critics over the HidroItuango project before his election last year.EPM nearly saw the dam destroyed in May last year after the temporary water discharge tunnels were blocked and the water in the reservoir almost flooded the entire project.Quintero’s “reiterated disregard of the board of directors” and their subsequent resignation further deepens the crisis initially caused by HidroItuango.Medellin’s mayor denied EPM was in crisis after by the resignation of the board of directors.According to EPM’s legal affairs chief, Alexander Sanchez, Quintero and Rendon’s failure to inform the board on the lawsuit against the contractors was “a communication error.”Medellin’s mayor and his EPM CEO also failed to inform the Antioquia Governor’s Office, one of the company’s main shareholders, acting Governor Luis Fernando Suarez said.According to former Mayor Federico Gutierrez, a political opponent of Quintero, the mayor’s handling of EPM “is a danger for Medellin,” which largely depends on the public utilities’ revenue for its budget.

" Colombia’s former president Alvaro Uribe said Wednesday he has been assigned his own inmate number after being placed under house arrest for allegedly tampering witnesses.In his first tweet in almost a week, Uribe claimed he had been assigned inmate number #1087985 “for confronting testimonies brought against me by [demobilized guerrilla group] FARC, its new generation and its allies.”The Supreme Court placed Uribe under house arrest last week after formally charging the former president with fraud and bribery.According to the court, evidence indicates that the former president bribed witnesses initially to file false charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda in 2014 and again in 2018 after the Supreme Court ordered to investigate Uribe.The former president’s defense said Tuesday that it would not challenge the house arrest, claiming that this would “facilitate its legitimacy.”Uribe and his brother Santiago have been sinking deeper and deeper into legal trouble over their alleged involvement in the formation of death squads in the 1990s’s and alleged attempt to subsequently cover this up.The former president’s claim he is the victim of a conspiracy by the “FARC, its new generation and its allies” is the latest in a series of baseless conspiracy theories.The former president initially filed criminal charges against Cepeda falsely claiming to be the victim of a conspiracy between the opposition lawmaker and former member of the Bloque Metro, the paramilitary group the Uribe family allegedly founded with convicted drug traffickers.After the Supreme Court found evidence these charges were bogus and the former president was forced to defend himself against fraud and bribery charges, Uribe claimed to be the victim of conspiracies by the Supreme Court, the former chief prosecutor and several congressmen.This strategy failed too and the court placed the former president under house arrest while proceeding with the investigation into Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery practices.

" The director of Colombia’s civil aviation authority Aerocivil said Wednesday that it will take at least a year to normalize domestic and international air travel.In an interview with newspaper El Espectador, Aerocivil director Juan Carlos Salazar said that “in the best case scenario it will take us at least a year” to normalize air traffic.Salazar’s best case scenario implies that Aerocivil’s plans that were leaked last month and sought the normalization of international air traffic in November are off the table.According to the Aerocivil chief, Colombia’s national government will lift its international flight ban on September 1 as planned, but the effective resumption of flights depends on foreign governments and mayors.Resuming that operation depends on many factors that are not under the control of the Civil Aeronautics and even the National Government, because we also have to wait for the decisions of other countries.Aerocivil director Juan Carlos SalazarMedellin Mayor Daniel Quintero authorized the reopening of airports for national pilot flights earlier this week, but Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez has yet to express any interest in reopening the capital’s El Dorado airport.El Dorado is Colombia’s main transport hub both for national and international flights, but can only reopen with Lopez’s authorization.Bogota is currently going through the worst part of the COVID-19 pandemic that spurred President Ivan Duque to suspend international air traffic on March 23.Lopez, the second most powerful public official in the country, has been fiercely critical of the operator of El Dorado airport ahead of the shutdown of air traffic and Duque’s economic reopening plans.Salazar told El Espectador that the reopening of Colombia’s largest airport has the highest priority for Aerocivil, but that this ultimately is the decision of Bogota’s mayor.It is an issue on which progress is being made with the greatest prudence, understanding the moment we are going through right now and understanding that when a route is opened it cannot be closed again, given the apparatus that has to be set in motion to operate.Aerocivil director Juan Carlos SalazarUnless Bogota’s mayor requests the reopening of specific flights and foreign governments lift flight bans that are in place, the normalization of international traffic will not happen in September as Aerocivil originally planned.Instead, Colombia’s civil aviation authorities has shifted towards the the World Tourism Organization, which said earlier this year it didn’t expect air traffic to begin normalizing until next year.  air travelcoronavirusnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-will-need-at-least-a-year-to-normalize-air-traffic/,Colombia will need ‘at least a year’ to normalize air traffic

" The defense of Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe said Tuesday it would not appeal a Supreme Court decision to place the controversial politician under house arrest, claiming this would “facilitate its legitimacy.”In a press release, Uribe’s defense attorney Jaime Granados summed up a number of alleged violations of the former president’s rights, but said that challenging the court’s “injustice” would be “naive.”Comunicado a la opinión pública de la defensa del señor Presidente @AlvaroUribeVel pic.twitter.com/sDTvvxjGcS— Jaime Granados Peña (@JGranadosPena) August 11, 2020An appeal would possibly also be futile as the Supreme Court unanimously ordered Uribe’s house arrest last week in a 1,554-page ruling in which the high court also formally filed fraud and bribery charges and accused the former president of obstructing justice.The Inspector General’s Office, which serves as guarantor for a fair trial, said it had no legal arguments to appeal the decision.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonThe house arrest of President Ivan Duque’s political patron and the leader of his far-right Democratic Center party is unprecedented and triggered a government crisis.Uribe’s party has tried to mobilize its base in its latest attempt to generate public pressure, but failed.According to the organizers’ own calculations, some 1,000 vehicles took part in the “Great Caravan for Uribe” from Medellin, the former president’s hometown, to his estate in the nearby Rionegro municipality on Monday.Local media, however, said “dozens” took part in this protest in support of Uribe, a former Medellin Cartel associate, whose popularity has been waning for years.Duque has reiterated his disagreement with the decision and has promoted the necessity of a judicial reform, but both Uribe’s legal defense and the president seem unable to do anything beyond expressing their opinion.The once-almighty former president has remained silent on Twitter, Uribe’s favorite media outlet, since Thursday last week as this could violate the conditions of the former president’s house arrest and result in Uribe being sent to jail.The Supreme Court has been investigating the former president since 2018 for allegedly trying to manipulate witnesses who have testified the Uribe family helped found paramilitary death squads in the 1990s.

" Colombia’s electoral authority opened an investigation into the campaign of President Ivan Duque whose 2018 election has been marred by fraud allegations.The National Electoral Council (CNE) will be investigating the alleged fraud of Duque’s Democratic Center Party (CD) based on evidence the far-right party conspired with a drug trafficking organization to rig the election and claims they illegally received funding from a Venezuelan oil tycoon.The evidence is derived from investigations into Jose Guillermo Hernandez, the late money launderer of the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa, and former President Alvaro Uribe, who is currently under house arrest.In the wiretaps of the money launderer called “El Ñeñe,” Uribe’s former personal assistant Maria Claudia Daza was conspiring with the late mafia figure to move “money under the table” ahead of the second round of the 2018 elections.CD president Nubia Stella Martinez was wiretapped saying she received $300,000 from “the Venezuelan” while Daza was being wiretapped as part of the ongoing witness tampering investigation against Uribe, the boss of the CD.The Colombian company of Venezuelan oil tycoon Oswaldo Cisneros contributed to Duque’s campaign, according to political news website La Silla Vacia.The CNE investigation will be carried out by magistrates Jaime Luis Lacauture of the Conservative Party, Virgilio Almanza who represents the center right Liberal Party, U Party and Radical Change, and Cesar Abreo of the Liberal Party.The participation of Lacauture is controversial as he campaigned for Duque in the northern La Guajira province where the narcos vowed to support Duque’s presidential ambitions.The CNE called both Daza and Martinez in for questioning on Tuesday.Additionally, the electoral authority said it wanted to talk to fugitive politician Aida Merlano, who accused Duque of being personally informed of vote-buying in the Atlantico province.President Ivan Duque is being investigated by Congress’ Accusation Committee and Uribe is being investigated by the Supreme Court as they allegedly took part in the election fraud.The Prosecutor General’s Office is supposed to be investigating the suspects who do not enjoy presidential or congressional privileges, but the office of chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa, a personal friend of the president, jailed the policemen who coincidentally discovered the election fraud conspiracy while investigating a homicide. 2018 electionsDemocratic Centerelection fraudIvan DuqueJose Guillermo HernandezMaria Claudia DazaNubia Stella Martinez ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-electoral-authority-investigating-alleged-2018-election-fraud/,Colombia’s electoral authority investigating alleged 2018 election fraud
" Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe used conspiracy theories to defend himself against a Supreme Court fraud and bribery investigation, but failed.According to the Supreme Court, whose 1,500-page document detailing the criminal charges was leaked, the president allegedly sought to bribe witnesses to discredit legitimate criminal investigations.Uribe even accused former Supreme Court Magistrate Jose Luis Barcelo, who opened the investigation, of conspiring against him based on a claim by extradited drug trafficker “El Tuso,” which “lacks evidence,” according to the court.According to the criminal charges, evidence indicates “what already appears as a modus operandi of the suspect and [fixer Diego] Cadena, which consists of using a certain fact or scenario from which false circumstances are invented or masked.”Both the former and Cadena were placed under house arrest last week.The Tasmania model“Tasmania”Uribe used a similar strategy to the one Ivan Velasquez used in 2007 to frustrate an investigation of a former Supreme Court magistrate, but failed.In a letter to the president, former paramilitary “Tasmania” accused Velasquez of offering judicial benefits if the paramilitary agreed to “blemish” Uribe.Tasmania retracted his statement, after which it became evident that the letter had been written by former intelligence executive Martha Leal and given to the the attorney of Uribe’s cousin Mario, who was investigated at the time.Colombia’s trial of the century: ‘Uribe’s fixer to be charged over witness tampering’The demobilized paramilitary survived an assassination attempt two months after the court opened the investigation against Uribe.Another false witness, demobilized paramilitary Carlos Enrique Areiza, was assassinated less than a week before the reported attack on Tasmania.According to the court, the Tasmania incident was a “serious precedent” exposing much of Uribe’s alleged “modus operandi.”Who is killing witnesses against Colombia’s former president?The alleged conspiracy theories“El Tuso”Apart from the alleged conspiracy theory involving the former Supreme Court magistrate, El Tuso also claimed he had been bribed by a committee of three senators and by former Prosecutor General Eduardo Montealegre who were all investigating the extradited drug traffickers’ ties to politicians.According to the Supreme Court, evidence indicates that Cadena “fixed” El Tuso’s testimony, but failed to contribute any supporting evidence.Both Uribe and his former fixer denied having sought out the extradited narco, but claimed they were approached. Unlike in the cases of other witnesses, the court said it had no evidence El Tuso was bribed.Colombia’s prosecution claims Uribe victim of fraud, bribery he allegedly committedThe alleged modus operandiDiego Cadena (L) and Alvaro Uribe.Uribe allegedly plotted the defense strategy to discredit several witnesses and investigations after which his attorneys, Jaime Granados and Jaime Lombana, turned to Cadena to support the former president’s conspiracy theories.Uribe’s attorneys would not get involved in Cadena’s alleged bribery practices. They would only use the testimonies the fixer had gathered at the instruction of the former president, evidence indicates.Uribe additionally would seek the help of others, like his senatorial aides, to coordinate matters and encounters with potential fake witnesses, a claim denied by the former president’s defense.Lastly, nobody in the defense team would verify the claims of the witnesses, leaving the court with nothing but baseless accusations.Colombia’s trial of the century: ‘Uribe’s fixer to be charged over witness tampering’How everything fell apartTo the indignation of Uribe’s defense lawyers, the court refused to accept the testimonies of criminal conduct against others without any evidence.Furthermore, one witness surrendered evidence he received bribes while another surrendered evidence he was offered judicial benefits.This evidence added to evidence that led the court to open an investigation against Uribe in 2018 and place the former president under house arrest last week.

" Colombia’s international trade is among the worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in the region, but the government appears to be ignoring international economists on how to recover.In its later report on the economic impact of the global crisis, the UN’s regional economic think tank ECLAC said Colombia’s exports dropped 25% between January and May compared to the same period last year, performing better only to Cuba and Venezuela.Imports dropped 18% compared to the first five months of last year, which put the country among the better performers, affecting domestic production.Latin America failing to integrateThe ECLAC urged to anticipate less trade with traditional trading partners like the United States, the European Union and China.The UN’s economic commission warned governments to expect more protectionist policies, which would result in a slow recovery of global trade and an increase in regional trade.The ECLAC decried the inability of Latin America to effectively promote regional economic integration that could make up for individual countries’ sharply dropped exports to outside the region.The region — which has seen major ideological polarization for example between Venezuela and Colombia — is going the opposite way than the rest of the world where concrete plans have been developed for regional integration.This regional standstill is causing the loss of its industrial capacities as factories are forced to close and extraordinarily hard impacts are affecting manufacturing and small and medium-sized businesses.This is causing the region to lose its productive capacities that are “difficult to recover,” according to the ECLAC.Consequently, the region will see worsening conditions for exports with fewer jobs, greater environmental degradation and increased inequality.Is Duque’s servitude to financial patrons tanking Colombia’s economy?ECLAC’s tips for regional economic integrationTo redesign the investment strategy favoring resilient, efficient and sustainable works that promote connectivity and adaptation and mitigation to climate change.Promote the interoperability of services through regulations and innovations for the use of combined, more efficient means of transport, and with less negative external factors.Strengthen regional integration with trade facilitation actions and coordinated investments that favor employment and productive transformation.Promote logistical intelligence through the use of ICT to improve decision-making and encourage faster, more competitive, secure and sustainable trade flows.Colombia’s fixation on pleasing crony capitalistsMarta Lucia Remirez (Image: Vice President’s Office)Colombia’s Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez said she will continue to follow the lead of the country’s controversial business association and showed interest in prioritizing exports to markets like the US and Europe, who the ECLAC warned are closing their doors.The VP did say she would hope to increase trade member nations of the Pacific Alliance and with newly founded regional organization Prosur that consists of conservative governments in the region.Additionally, she said she hoped to promote so-called “buy local” initiatives.As Duque’s economic reactivation falls apart, Colombia’s crony capitalists coin Plan BAgriculture only sector doing wellRegionally, the ECLAC said that only the agro-industrial sector saw a slight improvement of 4% compared to the first five months of last year, mainly due trade within the region.The Pacific port city of Buenaventura saw a staggering 33% drop compared to the same period last year, making the impoverished city the most severely hit in the entire Pacific region.Colombia’s road transport of cargo was the least affected by the reduced trade, registering only a 29% drop between January and May compared to the first five months of last year.According the ECLAC, only the exports of agricultural products have a chance of recovering this year.

" Members of Colombia’s far-right ruling party lost their wits on Tuesday after historic criminal charges against former President Alvaro Uribe left them without a leader.In a press release, the Democratic Center party said to be “indignant” the Supreme Court put Uribe under house arrest, abruptly ending the political career of arguably the most powerful politician in Colombia.The Supreme Court’s fraud and bribery charges and accusations Uribe had tried to obstruct justice were “slanderous” and “sustained by false witnesses,” according to the party, which was already weak because of their alleged drug trafficking ties.The unprecedented blow left President Ivan Duque’s party in shatters and senators barely able to hold back their tears on social media where they made one hopeless proposal after another to see their leader’s return to the Senate.One of the party’s most radical lawmakers, Senator Paloma Valencia, even proposed to do away with the judicial system investigating Uribe on fraud and bribery charges, which the party has been unsuccessfully promoting for years.The senator was almost in tears after she took to the streets only to find that few Colombians oppose justice and that the once almighty Uribe is left with a small group of hard-core followers and little political support.Only the coalition Conservative Party said they “regretted the situation the former ex-president is in,” but expressed its support for the Supreme Court.Radical Change party leader German Vargas, whose party also is in the coalition, stayed quiet.Uribe’s main political adversaries, former President Juan Manuel Santos and leftist Senator Gustavo Petro, coincidentally asked the court for the “best guarantees” Uribe will receive a fair trial.The outcome of Uribe’s trial looks bleak for the former president and the ruling party, who were humiliated in local elections last year.The Supreme Court’s statement justifying the house arrest was brutally straight-forward in claiming the magistrates’ unanimous decision to proceed with the trial is based on solid evidence, implying a conviction is only a matter of time.Uribe’s ejection from politics caused an unprecedented crisis in the government and the ruling party, which is now headless, and virtually nobody cared.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque and his party embarked on a PR campaign in defense of their political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, who may be days away from going to jail.Duque and his far-right Democratic Center party are increasingly nervous about the impending Supreme Court decision on Uribe, who is on trial on fraud and bribery charges.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonThe former president and former Medellin Cartel associate is Duque’s political patron and the undisputed boss of the controversial party, which has multiple leaders who have been closely associated with organized crime.In a press release, the Democratic Center said the court investigation into Uribe’s alleged witness tampering to file fraudulent charges against a political opponent is based on a “criminal fantasy” “woven by” “different elements associated to the armed left.”In an interview with his brother-in-law Nestor Morales, the boss of Blu Radio, President Ivan Duque said that “I believe, I have believed and always will believe in the innocence of Uribe.”I have had the opportunity in life to know, to deal with, to build a friendship with Alvaro Uribe Velez and I can say that he is a person who fits the word ‘honorability’ in all aspects of his life.President Ivan DuqueProminent Colombians close to the former president, some of whom with alleged links to terrorist groups, wrote the Supreme Court to defend Uribe and blame the investigation on “sectors historically opposed to the ideology” of the former president.We vehemently reject the harmful activism of sectors historically opposed to the ideology of former President Uribe, with which they seek to distort the facts by making an innocent man responsible for conduct he has never incurred.Uribe alliesThe Supreme Court began investigating Uribe in February 2018 after ruling that criminal charges filed by the former president against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda were possibly based on the testimonies of bribed witnesses, which would make the criminal charges fraudulent.Cepeda asked the Democratic Center to stop its “attempts to intimidate and pressure the magistrates” deciding about the former president’s fate.Since the fraud and bribery investigation, the court opened two other investigations against the former president who allegedly stepped up criminal activity in an attempt to maintain his waning political power.The Supreme Court began deliberations on Thursday last week to determine whether to allow Uribe to await trial in jail or at home if the court formally files criminal charges.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque is behaving like a “dictator” in his attempt to defend former President Alvaro Uribe against a Supreme Court detention order, opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda said Saturday.The opposition senator said he and his defense attorneys were looking into possible legal action against the president for his “constant attacks on the independence of the judicial branch” after the high court placed Uribe under house arrest.The opposition senator is the victim of the alleged witness tampering practices of the former president and boss of Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party.Cepeda’s warning followed warnings by Inspector General Fernando Carrillo who warned the president and other government officials to “abide by and comply with judicial decisions.”Duque said last week that the former president should defend himself against fraud and bribery charges in freedom and announced his support for a judicial reform promoted by his party.President Ivan Duque, it is typical of dictators and despots to control or destroy the judicial branch. This is how you behave: you repeatedly try to challenge and influence the Judiciary, you threaten to “reform” justice to redesign it in favor of your political mentor.Senator Ivan CepedaThe court’s historic decision to place Uribe under house arrest followed an investigation of more than two years over the former president’s alleged bribery of witnesses to file false charges against the opposition senator.Uribe’s house arrest plunged the government and the ruling party in crisis as the criminal charges would eject the former president from the Senate.The president has been an unconditional supporter of Uribe, who Duque called “the eternal president” while campaigning to succeed his political patron in 2018.Both the president and his political patron are investigated over their alleged involvement in a conspiracy with drug traffickers to rig these elections.These investigations and mounting evidence of ties between Uribe and drug traffickers led Duque’s opponent in the elections, opposition Senator Gustavo Petro, to claim the president is “illegitimate.” Alvaro UribeIvan CepedaIvan DuqueUribe trial ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-president-accused-of-behaving-like-dictator/,Colombia’s president accused of behaving like ‘dictator’

" The Medellin Cartel’s 1988 murder of a top anti-mafia official was one of the first indications that the US-promoted “National Security Doctrine” had become “the origin of evil” in Colombia.The military doctrine came to life in the 1960’s during the “Red Scare,” when paranoia over possible Soviet Union interference in the Americas was common, especially after the Cuban Missile Crisis.In a 2016 ruling, a Medellin Court called the US military doctrine “the origin of evil” after finding out that Colombian authorities, illegal armed groups and the mafia had been using the doctrine to justify any kind of violence.What is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine [is] not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game [with] the right to combat the internal enemy…: it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists. And this could mean anyone, including human rights activists such as myself.Colombia’s former Foreign Minister Alfredo VasquezThe narco history of Colombia’s security forces | Part 2: Medellin“High treason of the motherland”Carlos Mauro HoyosWhen late drug lord Pablo Escobar’s hitman “Popeye” called local radio station Todelar on January 25, 1988, something had gone very wrong.Four hours earlier, eight heavily armed men stopped the car of Inspector General Carlos Mauro Hoyos, assassinated his two bodyguards and kidnapped the severely injured inspector general.Popeye, who died earlier this year, called the radio station around 11:30AM to inform the public that “we executed him for high treason of the homeland.”The Medellin Cartel had long loved pseudo-politics, but the terms “high treason” and “the motherland” were National Security jargon, like “subversives” or “useful idiots.”Far-right paramilitary groups had been using this jargon to justify the killing of social leaders or unionists, but not the cartel.He was 47 years old.He was a serene man, 5’7″, light-eyed and with a long hair. An honest man of conviction: he defended human rights and confronted drug trafficking. He had become a handkerchief for the teardrops of all Colombians. That is why he was more than a civil servant, he was a conscience, the national conscience.El TiempoMedellin Cartel jargonEscobar’s wiretapped order to “just get rid of the son of a bitch” is a good example how the narcos used a far more colloquial jargon than the paramilitaries.In fact, Popeye was illiterate when he murdered the inspector general and didn’t learn how to read and write until after he was sent to prison in 1992.In a 2017 YouTube video, when Popeye had become an outspoken admirer of former President Alvaro Uribe, the late hitman claimed “Escobar ordered me to put him on trial for treason.”I followed the orders and told Hoyos that I was his judge and that he was sentenced to death for treason. Indignant, he protested and began to shout: “When did I ever betray my country?” And that’s when I killed him.“Popeye”The wiretaps were clear Escobar said no such thing.When the drug lord was in politics in the early 1980’s, he wasn’t interest ed in far-right political jargon, but others Popeye was hanging around with at the time were.The politicization of the narcosJose Gonzalo Rodriguez, a.k.a. “El Mexicano”Far-right paramilitary groups had been forming in the east of the Antioquia province had been receiving military education since the early 1980’s.These paramilitary groups teamed up with the Medellin Cartel’s death squad, MAS, in 1985, mainly to receive funding from Escobar and cartel founder Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez, a.k.a. “El Mexicano.”El Mexicano wanted to fight the now-disarmed FARC guerrillas as much as the paramilitaries, the military and the Americans.The criminalization of politicsYair KleinWith the help of the military and financial support from the cartel and large landowners, including Uribe, both the narcos and the paramilitaries were receiving combat training in 1987, according to former Israeli mercenary Yair Klein, who trained the men.Then-Armed Forces commander General Oscar Botero additionally changed the military regulations, adding that  “counter-insurgency war, ought to be carried out with the support of the civilian population and using paramilitary actions” just weeks before Hoyos was killed.There exists no indication Popeye took part in any of these courses, but some of his close associates did. Cartel member “La Quica,” for example, was sentenced for the 1989 bombing of an airplane using bomb-making techniques he learned with the paramilitaries.Popeye may have picked up a few terms from the National Defense Doctrine as the Medellin Cartel became more intimate with the military and the paramilitaries.The strengthening of ties between the three were nothing new when Escobar’s hitman brutally ended the life of one of the most admired men in Colombian judicial history.But Popeye’s phone call was one of the first signs that the narcos were becoming increasingly intimate with the far-right and becoming familiar with the US-promoted National Security doctrine.The murder of Hoyos, a strong supporter of extraditing the narcos to the US, was a sign that something had gone very wrong and that the military doctrine meant to to keep the USSR out of the Americas was used against US interests. drug traffickingMedellin Cartelnarcopoliticsparamilitariesparapolitics ",https://colombiareports.com/how-a-us-military-doctrine-became-colombias-origin-of-evil-part-1-popeye/,How a US military doctrine became Colombia’s ‘origin of evil’ | Part 1: “Popeye”
" Millions of Colombia’s public school children are left without education indefinitely after the education minister’s reopening plans turned out to be a disaster.In his daily COVID Facebook show, President Ivan Duque and Education Minister Maria Victoria Angulo said on July 19 that they had their school reopening plans all worked out with rotating attendance in 34 of the country’s 96 school districts, a combination of working in school and from home starting in areas with no or little COVID infections starting in August.The months of June and July we continue to work from home. From August onwards, we hope to regain presence with rotation.President Ivan DuqueThe president on May 23 had already claimed that “from day one, the minister has been thinking about how this return to attendance would be, but with a model that we have called the model of alternation, where there is work at home, where there is attendance, where there is virtuality.”On Sunday, Duque’s plan had turned into utter chaos, teachers and parents announced they would engage in civil disobedience and nobody knew when and in many cases if children would be able to return to school.Doing a Duque with educationEducation Minister Maria Victoria Angulo and President Ivan Duque (Image: President’s Office)On Wednesday, the minister told newspaper El Tiempo that only 32 school districts were still taking part in her vague rotation plans as “an important number of territorial entities… decided to continue with the process” of only giving classes virtually if possible.Many districts had backed out because the minister didn’t have the funds that would allow schools to comply with health protocols, and Angulo had forgotten that rural and poor children have poor access to internet and reliable testing.The rotation model the minister had seen in countries like Germany, France and Spain is not applicable in Colombia where some schools don’t even have running water, according to teachers who said they were never consulted.Because also parents associations began protesting, Angulo told El Tiempo that attending class would be voluntary.Teachers union Fecode blasted the minister’s “capricious, stubborn and irresponsible attitude” and said “the teachers will NOT be present in educational facilities.”If any teacher was expected to appear in school anywhere in Colombia, they would “engage in civil disobedience,” the union said.Norte de Santander School Association president Cesar Tulio Garcia told newspaper La Opinion they would not take part in the minister’s “experiment” with the lives of teachers, children and their families and said they would also engage in civil disobedience.Minister gives upThe minister returned to Duque’s Facebook show on Thursday and said that “the evolution of the pandemic forces us to continue with education from home.”Let’s continue virtually and we will be addressing the processes of alternation, depending on how the experts and we observe the behavior of the pandemic.Education Minister Maria Victoria Angulo“In certain municipalities, in certain school, they are defining pilots” involving rotating school attendance, Angulo persisted, claiming that she had a $24 million budget for this.The minister stopped making sense entirely on Saturday when she told newspaper La Patria that city halls would “eventually” decide on the resumption of classes with the rotating attendance of students.Teachers fed upNelson Alarcon (Image: Colprensa)Fecode president Nelson Alarcon told weekly Semana on Sunday that “we will not go to school,”“In the middle of a pandemic that’s not possible,” Alarcon added. In fact, “we don’t believe it’s possible to return to attending classes this year,” the Fecode president told newspaper El Espectador.Alarcon said that virtual classes will continue, but stressed that the minister’s botched plan is and lack of a plan B is depriving children from poor and rural families of their right to education.In the countryside “almost 75 % of the pupils have no access an internet connection to develop their work while in the urban part, 40 % do not have connectivity,” said Alarcon.To improve this, “we proposed to the minister of education a policy of free universal connectivity so that students can continue their education,” a proposal that apparently fell on deaf ears.To push Angulo to come with a return plan that doesn’t exclude poor and rural Colombians, Fecode announced their civil disobedience would kick off on Monday with protests “in defense of life and health.” coronaviruseducationMaria Victoria Angulo ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-schools-closed-indefinitely-after-reopening-plans-flunk/,Colombia’s schools closed indefinitely after reopening plans flunk

" In an absurd change of events, Colombia’s prosecution claimed on Monday that former President Alvaro Uribe was the victim of the fraud and bribery charges filed against him by the Supreme Court.Prosecutor Daniel Hernandez, who is facing multiple corruption probes and at least one illegal wiretapping investigation, ignored the court’s evidence Uribe ordered his fixer Diego Cadena to bribe witnesses, and claimed Uribe was the victim of his fixer.To add to the surprise, Cadena was not sent to prison, but granted was house arrest until Friday when the judge deciding on his fate will hear from the victim of Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery conspiracy, opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda, and the Inspector General’s Office.How Colombia’s former president ended up with one foot in prisonThe prosecution lost the rule of law?Diego Cadena (Image: Twitter)In blatant violation of the norms, Hernandez additionally ordered the house arrest of Cadena, who is accused of obstruction of justice and had previously fled the country after hearing he could be jailed.The controversial prosecutor’s latest stunt made it all but evident the Prosecutor General’s Office is trying to prevent the Supreme Court from convicting Uribe on fraud and bribery charges.Previously, former prosecution executive Danny Julian Quintana was accused of manipulating court evidence in custody of the prosecution in July last year.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa, a long-time friend of President Ivan Duque, has been accused of trying to corrupt investigations against Uribe on multiple occasions while alleging charges against Uribe were trumped up.Colombia’s chief prosecutor too busy harassing critics to fight crime?With Uribe off the hook, Cadena has every motive to runCarlos Enrique Velez, a.k.. “Victor”Before Hernandez’s jaw-dropping claim that Uribe was a victim, the prosecutor gave Cadena every reason to  run and escape justice by making it clear he stood no chance in court without  evidence indicating Uribe’s fixer was following his boss’s orders.According to Hernandez, Cadena tried to coerce former paramilitary fighter Juan Guillermo Monsalve and paid former paramilitary commander “Victor” $54,000 (COP200 million) to discredit the testimony of “Alberto Guerrero,” who testified Uribe and his brother formed paramilitary groups after the death of their family’s associate Pablo Escobar in the 1990’s .Victor’s testimony came during the first of the Supreme Court’s hearings in the Uribe case and provided even more evidence against Uribe which triggered the court to order the prosecution to investigate Cadena on four criminal charges.Uribe’s fixer denied the charges.Pending criminal charges against CadenaBriberyInfluence peddlingObstruction of justiceImpersonating an officer of the lawUribe admitted he knew evidence given to Colombia’s top court was fabricated: reportCommitting bribery to make bribery charges go away?Diego Cadena (L) and Alvaro Uribe.The prosecution’s extraordinary claim Uribe is a victim may be bad news for his fixer, but will have no direct affect on the trial against the former president, who is being investigated by the Supreme Court.The court opened an investigation against Uribe in 2018 after finding evidence that the former president’s 2014 criminal charges against opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda were fraudulent because they were based on the testimonies of allegedly bribed witnesses.Apparently, the former president believed he could make the fraud and bribery charges go away by involving Cadena to commit more fraud and bribery while under investigation and being wiretapped.This strategy failed miserably as Victor, the first witness, flipped and admitted to having received bribes from Cadena.How Uribe’s fixer tries to avoid Colombia issuing an arrest warrantWill Cadena take the rap, flip or run from justice?Uribe interrogated by Supreme Court justice Gerardo Reyes.The former president’s fate partially depends on whether Cadena will take responsibility for Uribe’s alleged bribery practices or take the risk of turning on the former president and have happen to him what is popularly know as “suicide by Uribe,” i.e. being assassinated like other witnesses.Released court evidence indicating the former president ordered his fixer to manipulate witnesses, however, could add perjury to the “ganstattorney’s” growing list of alleged crimes without having done Uribe any good.Cadena told Uribe in a phone call that was being being wiretapped that he would take the rap for the alleged bribery, but has said in public that he would not.In either scenario, the future of former president’s fixer looks bleak. Uribe’s future doesn’t look much better.Hernandez, however, effectively gave Cadena a much more attractive option which is to run from justice.

" Colombia’s Supreme Court sentenced a controversial governor and ally of President Ivan Duque to five years in prison for election fraud.The governor of the northern Cesar province and heir of the Gnecco crime family, Luis Alberto Monsalve, was convicted for buying votes ahead of the 2011 elections.The court asked President Ivan Duque to suspend the youngest heir of crime family that helped Duque win the presidential elections in 2018.Gnecco’s political party, the U Party,  will be expected to pick a replacement for their latest convicted government executive.According to the Supreme Court, Monsalve committed election fraud by promising decent housing to a community of displaced families in his successful first bid to become governor.After being replaced by a family associate in 2015, the son of family matriarch Cielo Gnecco was reelected again last year.Monsalve’s cousin is “Pajarito,” a money launderer of Marquitos Figueroa, whose drug trafficking organization conspired with Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party and the president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, to buy votes in the Caribbean region in 2018.Colombia’s ruling party allegedly involved multiple crime families in 2018 election fraud plotThe latest convict of the crime family, which is closely tied to both politics and organized crime in the north of Colombia, did not immediately say if he would appeal the verdict.The Gnecco family is one of Colombia’s most notorious crime families who began trafficking marijuana to the United States during the so-called “Bonanza Marimbera” in the 1970’s.The notoriously criminal in-laws of one of Colombia’s most famous journalistsLike the family of Duque’s political patron, former president Alvaro Uribe, the Gnecco crime family became a member of the vast network of associates of Pablo Escobar, which allowed them to gain prominence in both organized crime and politics.Following the death of Escobar, the Gnecco family founded a paramilitary group in Cesar while Uribe signed off on at least 20 in his home Antioquia province.Despite their decades-long ties to organized crime, both families continue to exercise significant political control, both in their home provinces and Congress. 2011 electionsCesarelection fraudGnecco clan ",https://colombiareports.com/crime-family-heir-and-ally-of-colombias-president-sent-to-prison-over-election-fraud/,Crime family heir and ally of Colombia’s president sent to prison over election fraud

" Colombia’s government has developed a number of tricks to minimize the COVID-19 pandemic and even cover up response failures and the adverse effects of its “economic recovery” plan.Like almost all the world’s governments, the administration of President Ivan Duque has been completely overwhelmed by the coronavirus that has ravaged the global economy and brought some of the world’s best-equipped healthcare systems to their knees.Duque and Health Minister Fernando Ruiz’ controversial response threatens to make Colombia one of the worst hit countries in the world, which they have been trying to conceal using all kinds of tricks.1) Duque’s daily COVID Variety ShowPresident Ivan DuqueInstead of managing the crisis, President Ivan Duque locked himself up in the presidential palace from where he has been hosting a daily propaganda show on facebook.The show would have gone unnoticed had the country’s servile corporate media not showed the president’s “Prevention and Action” show on their websites and replicated Duque’s endless promises and claims of success.While the president’s show did provide some comic relief in times of hardship, Duque’s amplification of positive statistics or the minimal risk for people under 70 made many believe stay at home orders were exaggerated and almost impossible to enforce.Most seriously, perhaps, the country’s health authorities appear to have wasted 10% of scarce coronavirus tests to present recovery results, ignoring scientists’ convictions that any infected person is no longer able to infect others two weeks after not showing symptoms.Duque opposes lockdown in Colombia’s capital despite healthcare collapse2) The false promisesThe government’s promised response consisted largely of lies, according to several studies.Duque said in March he would invest 11% of the country’s GDP, some $35 billion dollars,to bolster the country’s healthcare sysetems, curb poverty and mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic, but he didn’t fullfill this promise.The Javeriana University said last week it was only able to verify the spending of $1.6 billion dollars, more than half of which came with vague descriptions like “apparent necessities” or the “strengthening” of the entities that received the funds.“Of the transfers received because of the pandemic that are well documented, only $1.1 billion dollars of emergency spending has been reported to the public with an acceptable level of accuracy,” according to the university.The investigative journalism website,Cuestion Publica, found that only $110 million dollars, 9.3% of the $1.5 billion Duque promised to inject in healthcare, actually arrived.Some $414 million dollars of this money that was promised to the National Disaster Prevention and Response Unit is unaccounted for as it was transferred to an obscure trust fund called the Fiduprevisora that has failed to make its financial records public, according to the investigative journalism website.Colombia’s healthcare collapsing as Duque’s $1.5B injection promise turns out 93% hot air3) The show minister of healthHealth Minister Fernando RuizAlso the health minister seems to have spent more energy in faking a response to the pandemic than actually responding to it.The most blatant example of this was Ruiz’s visit to the Amazonas’ province where the alleged corruption of the governor and the former director of the hospital in the capital Leticia had literally turned the local hospital into ruins.The minister’s aides cleaned up part of the rubbish that was piled up throughout the hospital to allow the minister to shoot a fancy propaganda video about the medical equipment he was delivering.Locals said that Ruiz took medical equipment back to Bogota after his propaganda stunt, leaving them by themselves to deal with the virus that was causing carnage in the town.Colombia’s healthcare show: ‘If you get sick, you die and that’s the truth’4) Not testing the dead?Leticia’s emergency cemeteryColombia, like almost all countries, has been unable to carry out enough testing to make credible calculations about the spread of the coronavirus because of a global shortage of test kits.While this is a disaster regarding the effective detection of and responses to infections, it has helped to keep the reported number of infections at only a fraction of what they really are.Multiple doctors in the northern city of Barranquilla told Reuters earlier this month that people who had died of suspected COVID-19 at home or even waiting in the emergency room were never tested.“If we add cases which aren’t confirmed…we could multiply these numbers by two or three,” the incoming president of the Caribbean chapter of the Colombian Association of Internal Medicine, Juan Marquez, told the British newspaper.At the time, Barranquilla was the most tested city in the country, according to Health secretary Humberto Mendoza.Daily confirmed COVID-19 deathsSource: National Health Institute5) Only testing the rich?One resident from Santander and one former lab worker from Bogota confirmed to Colombia Reports that labs were only carrying out tests for people with private health insurance.Before that, this website had already identified labs advertising testing for as much as $80 dollars apparently without applying any epidemiological strategy that would have the intention of trying to strategically locate infections and possible outbreaks.Districts in Barranquilla and Medellin where large numbers of people had fallen ill were militarized without any indication they were being tested.In Leticia, a local told Colombia Reports, test results took more than two weeks, which is the time it takes to either die of COVID-19 or survive and no longer be infectious.With outbreaks reported mainly in notoriously poor regions and urban areas, where obeying stay at home orders would effectively starve people to death, this could further distort the country’s testing results. coronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/duques-top-5-tricks-to-cover-up-colombias-covid-19-emergency/,Duque’s tricks to cover up Colombia’s COVID-19 crisis

A quarter of confirmed COVID-19 deaths fell in the capital, a city of 7 million.According to the Bogota Medical College, healthcare in the capital collapsed already on Thursday last week, a claim that is contradicted by Mayor Claudia Lopez and President Ivan Duque.Healthcare in Medellin, the country’s second largest city, has also collapsed and hospitals are unable to treat patients in a timely manner.The healthcare collapses are creating major tensions between the medical community and government institutions, and between mayors, governors and the national government. coronavirushealthcare crisisnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/covid-19-in-colombia-deaths-surge-after-cities-healthcare-collapse/,COVID-19 in Colombia: deaths surge after cities’ healthcare collapse

Medical professionals claimed statistics are being manipulated and beds are reserved for VIPs.These four cities and their metropolitan areas are home to approximately one third of Colombia’s population.Caribbean region apparently past peakIn Barranquilla, Colombia’s fourth largest city, local authorities said the ICU occupancy rate had dropped to 69% weeks after healthcare in the Caribbean region collapsed.Also in Cartagena, which saw the first peak, the ICU occupancy rate had reportedly dropped to 67%. Only Santa Marta’s hospital system continues to be saturated, according to local reports.Despite the alleged healthcare collapse in four of Colombia’s five largest cities, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz rejected the plea of Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez to follow the advice of medical organization to issue a decree for a full-blown shut-down.Health minister contradicting his own statisticsContradicting his ministry’s statistics, Ruiz told press that a second lockdown was not necessary as the capital “shows stability in the figures for confirmed cases, deaths and ICU” during President Ivan Duque’s daily COVID show on Facebook.Colombia refuses to shut down capital despite hospital saturationDuque and his health minister have refused to consider a second lockdown and have been reluctant to authorize other local measures that would respectively end or slow down their controversial reopening strategy.Lopez and the country’s main medical organizations have blasted this strategy for causing the accelerated increase in infections and hospital admissions that have now collapsed healthcare in the country’s largest cities.According to the INS, it has registered more than 211,000 cases, of which more than 7,166 turned out to be fatal.Health organizations, however, have reiterated that the country’s limited testing capacity makes these numbers unreliable and that the real number of infections are likely multiple times higher than those reported by the INS. coronavirushealthcare crisis ",https://colombiareports.com/covid-19-all-but-collapses-healthcare-in-colombias-largest-cities/,COVID-19 all but collapses healthcare in Colombia’s largest cities
" Ernesto Yamhure is a mysterious publisher who used his column in newspaper El Espectador and Caracol Radio to help a late paramilitary leader manipulate the US government over pending drug trafficking charges.While journalists like Vicky Davila and Virginia Vallejo ended up associated with the mafia blinded by love, Yamhure’s far-right ideology appeared to have blurred his loyalty to the rule of law.“They traffic in illicit drugs”AUC founder Carlos Castaño“They traffic in illicit drugs, for which a large part of the leadership of this terrorist group has been convicted and requested for extradition,” the pundit wrote about the now-demobilized FARC guerrilla group in 2007.Yamhure was right. The US designated the FARC a terrorist group in 1997 and indicted its leaders on drug trafficking charges in November 2002, weeks after indicting Carlos Castaño, the founder of paramilitary organization AUC.Six weeks after the paramilitary leader’s indictment, Castaño asked his “friend” at El Espectador to include “his abandoning of any participation in drug trafficking activities” in a column “since that is what the United States expects,” according to emails revealed in 2011.“Not the anti-FARC freedom fighters”Former US Attorney General John AshcroftYamhure went up in smoke after finding out the prosecution was investigating his ties to Castaño and the AUC, who were indicted “not as the anti-FARC freedom fighters they claim to be, but as criminals and violent drug traffickers,” as former US Attorney General John Ashcroft put it in 2002.The pundit hasn’t returned to Colombia since and for a good reason; the mouthpiece of the designated terrorist wanted for trafficking 17 tons of cocaine failed to appear at four hearings that were part of a criminal investigation, newspaper El Tiempo reported in 2012, and could get arrested as soon as he sets foot in Bogota.Yamhure announced he would continue to take part in Colombia’s political debate “from exile” after his defense attorney claimed the US government had granted his client political asylum in 2013.Miami and the Medellin CartelSenator Jose Obdulio Gaviria (center top) and Pablo Escobar (center bottom)Weeks later, the former columnist joined the cousin of late drug lord Pablo Escobar, Senator Jose Obdulio Gaviria, to open the Miami office of the Democratic Center, the newly founded party of former President Alvaro Uribe, another former Medellin Cartel associate.Yamhure’s contributions to the political debate only resulted in more criminal charges, especially after the pundit called renowned journalist Cecilia Orozco — oh irony — a narcojournalist.In 2016, Yamhure founded “Los Irreverentes,” a website mainly for fellow-former mafia associates with political opinions.The website became an instant flop, but at least allows Yamhure to tell the Internal Revenue Service he has a legal income.

" Colombia could see the world’s fifth highest number of COVID-19 deaths if President Ivan Duque continues to refuse a second lockdown, according to the country’s medical community.Duque has openly opposed a second lockdown that would end his controversial strategy to reactivate the economy.The president on Tuesday will meet with representatives of the medical community and Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez, who both said they will urge a second  lockdown, initially in Bogota, to prevent unnecessary deaths and allow a more controlled reopening of the economy.The Colombian Medical Federation (FMC) and its members additionally have urged Duque to issue a decree that would initially provide Bogota residents with an emergency basic income Congress has proposed for the entire country.According to the FMC, a renewed lockdown would allow Bogota’s healthcare system to recover and give the capital’s healthcare authorities the necessary time to expand its hospital capacity.Additionally, a lockdown would give the national authorities time to move intensive care workers from areas barely affected by the pandemic to Bogota and other cities where healthcare is on the brink of collapse.Lopez has denied her city’s healthcare system has collapsed, but said on Thursday she agreed with the FMC’s recommendations.Both have blasted Duque’s chaotic reopening of the economy, claiming this is one of the causes of healthcare in Colombia’s largest economies to be collapsing.Lopez and the FMC also agree that a second attempt to reactivate the economy should be more flexible and be responsive to possible outbreaks.The FMC also urged to prioritize the increase in the testing capacity of the National Health Institute (INS) in regards to the number of tests and the speed of results coming back.The INS has drastically expanded its testing capacity, but is still carrying out only half of the tests that are necessary to locate outbreaks, according to FMC director Sergio Isaza.In order to be able to timely respond to outbreaks, the time it takes for a test result to be returned should be reduced from 10 days to no more than 72 hours, the FMC said.Unless the FMC and Lopez are able to convince Duque, Colombia risks mourning the fifth highest number of COVID-19 related deaths in the world, the federation’s VP told Noticias Uno.

" Doctors in Colombia’s capital Bogota have begun denying critical care for elderly COVID-19 patients after the saturation of intensive care units (ICU’s) has forced them to prioritize the young.Several families, local media and the vice-president of the Colombian Medical Federation said the Palermo Clinic in the capital was denying ICU’s to patients older than 75 years old.In an interview with Noticias Uno, the vice-president of the Colombian Medical Federation, Carolina Corcho, said Saturday that at almost 80 people have died in Bogota while waiting to be transferred to intensive care.The heart-wrenching dilemma faced by doctors in Bogota is similar to that of their Italian colleagues in March when the coronavirus was collapsing healthcare in the country that was hardest hit by the pandemic in Europe.The doctors’ nightmare and the families’ despairOne 85-year-old patient was able to receive intensive care in the Simon Bolivar hospital after public pressure, but the family of an 86-year-old patient said Saturday their father was denied a promised ICU after younger patients arrived.Yesterday, they had an intensive care unit bed ready for him, but four people arrived and they said we had to reserve the bed for these people because they were between 40 and 50 years old.Son of Marco Antonio CarrilloThe provision policy to prioritize younger patients was confirmed by the vice-president of the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC), Carolina Corcho, who said another family was told the same.The family expressed that they refuse to transfer him to the ICU, because they have been prioritized for people under the age of 75.FMC vice-president Carolina CorchoPoliticians downplaying gravity of COVID-19 crisisPresident Ivan Duque and Mayor Claudia Lopez have denied the collapse of Bogota’s healthcare system, but are contradicted by medical organizations and locals.Both have been racing to expand the hospitals’ ICU capacity, but are running out of trained personnel.The Bogota Medical College said Friday only the public hospitals of Engativa and the National University still had beds.Private hospitals that have limited capacity apparently are not made available despite having been merged with the public hospital system.Lopez received the support of Nicolas Garcia, the governor of the surrounding Cundinamarca province, who vowed on Thursday he would allow Bogota patients to be admitted to hospitals in nearby cities and towns.Duque claimed on Saturday that it was his idea to open Cundinamarca hospitals for COVID-19 patients from Bogota during his daily COVID-show on Facebook.Colombia overtaking ItalyThe global coronavirus pandemic is on its way to ravage Colombia more than Italy, which reported 6,557 new cases on the peak day of the pandemic in March.Colombia’s National Health Institute (INS) has reported more than 8,000 cases for three days in a row while the peak in Bogota is not expected until August and not until September in other parts of the country.Bogota’s healthcare collapse follows that of historically neglected regions in the south of the country and along the Pacific coast.The situation in the Caribbean region is equally critical as authorities are unable to keep up with the rapid contagion of the virus that has killed more than 6,500 people in Colombia and more than 600,000 worldwide.

" Colombia’s opposition decided to make politics interesting by introducing a bill that seeks to end the war on drugs by decriminalizing cocaine and regulating its production.The bill is sponsored by Senators Feliciano Valencia, an indigenous leader, and centrist Senator Ivan Marulanda, and seeks legislation on cocaine similar to American marijuana laws.The cocaine regulation bill is part of a package introduced by members of the the leftist opposition and the centrist voting block last year to end the so-called war on drugs, and implement effective counternarcotics strategies and policies to curb drug abuse.Colombia’s congress strikes back at Duque with bills to end war on drugsFighting drug traffickingSenator Ivan Marulanda (Image: Ivanmarulanda – Trabajo propio, CC BY 3.0, EnlaceThe cocaine regulation bill seeks strict state control over the cultivation of coca and the production of cocaine, which is currently controlled by illegal armed groups and drug trafficking organizations.While the bill does not rule out the legal export of cocaine for scientific purposes, it mainly intends to cut the finances of drug trafficking organizations and illegal armed groups like the ELN, Marulanda told newspaper El Tiempo.This bill is part of the fight against drug trafficking because it is about getting rid of those mafias that profit from it, destroying the Colombian people along the way.Senator Ivan MarulandaThe senior Green Alliance senator stressed he considers himself a victim of the war on drugs and drug trafficking alike as he lost close political allies like former Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara and Liberal Party dissident Luis Carlos Galan, who were killed by the Medellin Cartel in the 1980’s.The control over coca cultivation and cocaine production by mafias and illegal armed groups exposes Colombian society “to all kinds of risks, because they will seek their profit regardless of legal and moral limits.”The state assuming this control would destroy what has become an entire illegal economy and allow the scientific investigation of both coca and cocaine for their medicinal properties both in Colombia and abroad.Fighting drug abuseTo curb cocaine dependency, the bill seeks to regulate the sale of cocaine by allowing adults to register as a consumer and, with the permission of a physician, allow them to buy a gram of cocaine per week from licensed cocaine sellers.A similar bill introduced last year seeks to decriminalize marijuana and introduce improved access to healthcare for users suffering drug dependency.Colombia’s congress preparing bill to legalize marijuanaOpposition to be considerableSenator Jose Obdulio Gaviria (center top) and late drug lord Pablo Escobar (center bottom)While there is relatively broad consensus in Colombia that repressive strategies to curb drug use and international drug trafficking have failed, the approval of the bill is likely to cause opposition, both in Colombia and from the United States, which has been able to increase regional influence through the war on drugs.In Colombia, the fiercest opposition comes from Duque’s far-right Democratic Center (CD) party, which is led by former President Alvaro Uribe, who has been tied to drug trafficking since the early days of the Medellin Cartel.According to CD Senator Jose Obdulio Gaviria, a cousin of late drug lord Pablo Escobar, the CD would “fully oppose” the legalization of cocaine, the drug that partly financed Duque’s 2018 election, according to evidence investigated by the Supreme Court and the prosecution.Gaviria told El Tiempo his party would oppose the bill “above all for geopolitical reasons.” According to Escobar’s cousin, “Colombia cannot become a pariah country.”Senator Rodrigo Lara, the son of the assassinated justice minister, told the newspaper that he did not oppose the decriminalization of cocaine, but considered the proposal nonviable without international support.This regulation will come at some point, but the problem is that legalizing cocaine cannot be a unilateral decision by Colombia, there should be a factor of diplomatic integration; in the meantime, we have no alternative other than to combat criminal groups.Senator Rodrigo LaraInfluential counternarcotics expert Daniel Rico told El Tiempo that the decriminalization of cocaine would have an impact on organized crime groups’ finances, but would unlikely deal a major blow to these organizations because of their ability to switch to different criminal activities.

" Laundering money is as important for Colombia’s drug trade as exporting cocaine. Without it, drug trafficking would be nothing but a hobby or a charitable activity.Following this money has historically been almost impossible because of tax havens that allow money to move around internationally almost invisibly with the help of Colombia’s largely informal economy.Nobody really knows how much drug money is laundered, because the method is used to launder revenue of all kinds of illegal activity, for example gold mining.How much money are we talking about?According to the latest report of the United States’ Drug enforcement Agency, Colombian drug trafficking organizations “generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually through the sale of drugs in the United States” alone and contributed 0.4% to Colombia’s GDP, according the White House.Colombia’s former Agriculture minister Andres Felipe Arias calculated in 2018 that cocaine exports had reached a value of $46 billion. The politician is serving a 17-year prison sentence though, making his estimates hardly reliable.Andes University investigators Santiago Montenegro, Jorge Llano and Diana Ibañez calculated this to be $18.3 billion late last year. Their academic investigation claimed drug trafficking contributed almost 2% to the country’s 2018 GDP.Laundering money abroadTo understand how money laundering works, it’s important to realize that it basically consists of two components, moving money from abroad into Colombia and inserting illicit funds into the country’s legal economy.This means that money may be laundered before entering Colombia or after.Money that is laundered abroad, for example in Mexico, the United States or in tax havens can legally be invested in Colombia and is virtually untraceable.Among the 10 main foreign investor countries to Colombia are four tax havens, indicating a lot of money could be laundered abroad before legally entering the Colombian economy.Laundering money in ColombiaThe International Monetary Fund, multiple financial watchdogs and the prosecution have noticed that the most popular sectors to launder money or to invest laundered money in Colombia have barely changed over the past decades.Construction, real estate and particularly land ownership have been the narcos’ favourite investments since the 1980s. Particularly, the accumulation of private land is considered suspicious because they can provide protected drug trafficking routes.Like almost anywhere in the world, casinos also continue to be extremely vulnerable. In downtown Medellin alone, for example, there are almost 20 in an area no larger than 2.5 square kilometers.Especially after the demobilization of the AUC between 2003 and 2006, Colombia’s second largest city saw an explosion of bakeries as the local crime syndicate appeared to be switching from managing international drug trafficking routes to managing the trade’s finances.Law enforcement has also increasingly been keeping an eye on accountants and attorneys, which got one of the defense lawyers of former President Alvaro Uribe in trouble with US authorities after they found he reportedly was moving money around through multiple accounts in Aruba.What the prosecution appears to be chronically overlooking is how drug money is inserted into political campaigns, allowing organized crime organizations to get their return on investment by getting their lackeys elected.The new strategiesOne of the strategies that have grown in popularity over the past five years is exchanging Venezuelan bolivares for Colombian pesos or US dollars along the eastern border.A more complex strategy that helps money launderers to keep out of sight of financial watchdogs has been the use of contraband to barter cocaine exports, which created a sort of triangle in which China became a major player.This contraband is then sold through a network of shops mainly in Bogota, Medellin and Cali whose revenue, like with other networks such as drug stores and bakeries that use a lot of cash, end up in the hands of narcos.Venezuela and Ecuador have become increasingly important to barter firearms for money, as well as the US where firearms are dismantled and mixed with scrap metal and reassembled in Colombia. drug traffickingmoney launderingorganized crime ",https://colombiareports.com/laundering-colombias-drug-money-part-1-how-to-do-it/,Laundering Colombia’s drug money | Part 1: how to do it
" Colombia’s Congress’s kicks off its new legislative year electing an allegedly criminal Senate president in a possibly illegal home-commuting session on Monday.Outgoing Senate President Lidio Garcia unilaterally decided to inaugurate the new legislative year from home 10 days after the Constitutional Court ruling dumped the presidential decree allowing this.The Constitutional Court ruled that the legislative branch — not the president — has the authority to change regulations that would allow the lawmakers to work from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Anarchy in CongressSenator Lidio Garcia (Image: Twitter)The party leaders of the House of Representatives are expected to convene in the capitol and vote on the regulation allowing home-commuting that would allow the representatives to elect a new president from home.Garcia’s decision that he, and not the Senate, takes the decisions in the high chamber creates the possibility that the court declares that the Liberal Party senator is unauthorized as the president to do this.This would consequently nullify the election of a new Senate president on Monday and every other vote taken by the Senate unconstitutional unless the court changes the rules.Court sinks decree allowing Colombia’s congress to work from homeAlleged criminal aheadSenator Arturo Char (Screenshot: YouTube)As if Garcia’s creative interpretation of democracy wasn’t weird enough, a Senate majority is in favor of electing Senator Arturo Char, an alleged criminal investigated by the Supreme Court, president while the country is in an unprecedented crisis.The leading member of the notoriously corrupt Char Clan used to be famous for his mediocre success as a pop singer until the Supreme Court began investigating alleged election fraud in 2018 and his alleged participation in the jailbreak of a lawmaker last year.According to Alejandra Barrios, the director of election observation NGO MOE, this leaves the impression Congress is less committed to dealing with Colombia’s worst economic crisis in history than respecting backroom deals leaving an allegedly criminal pop singer in charge of the Senate.To have a president of Congress with ongoing investigations is going to be a questionable presidency and one that unfortunately does not begin with the capacity and leadership that it needed at this time.MOE director Alejandra BarriosThe ‘clans’: the criminal forces rigging Colombia’s economy and democracyCan Congress sink any lower?Congress was already considered Colombia’s most corrupt public institution, a questionable honor it seems to want to consolidate by electing an allegedly corrupt pop singer as president.While concerns are growing that some of the allegedly most inept politicians in the country, Duque and Char, are facing the crisis of the century while neck-deep in corruption investigations, the projected senate president has allegedly gone into hiding to avoid having to respond over the feared quagmire.Unbelievable: Arturo Char will become president of Congress by denying interviews and keeping silent.

" Illegal armed groups have been brutally imposing COVID-19 measures in areas where Colombia’s state is historically weak, Human Rights Watch said Wednesday.In a report, the human rights organization said it had received reports of illegal armed groups imposing their own measures in 11 of Colombia’s 32 provinces.The groups mentioned were guerrilla group ELN, paramilitary group AGC, dissidents of the demobilized FARC guerrilla group, narco-guerrillas EPL and “The Mafia,” a drug trafficking organization in the south of the country.According to HRW, the groups mainly used pamphlets and Whatsapp to lay down the rules in areas under their control, often threatening people violating these rules with death.Measures imposed by armed groups have further undermined people’s ability to secure adequate food without providing alternative options, residents, community leaders, humanitarian actors, and local church authorities told Human Rights Watch.Human Rights WatchPrevious reports indicated that illegal armed groups have used the pandemic to expand their territorial control. HRW said to have evidence they were also using the health emergency to more strictly impose their social control.In some areas, the illegal armed groups have maintained strict lockdowns also after the government began relaxing the lockdown it called on March 25 and are even disallowing sick people to go to the hospital.Humanitarian workers said that armed groups in parts of Nariño, Arauca, Putumayo, and Guaviare have not allowed people, including those who are sick, to leave their homes at all during curfews.Human Rights WatchColombia Reports received reports from this website that in the northeastern Arauca province, ELN guerrillas were even patrolling roads to enforce a government-endorsed lockdown in the early weeks of the pandemic.HRW said it had documented nine killings connected to illegal armed groups’ COVID-19 measures in Cauca, Putumayo and Nariño in the southwest of the country.Until the FARC’s demobilization in 2017, the southern and eastern provinces mentioned by the HRW were largely controlled by this group, but have fallen under the brutal rule of other illegal armed groups following state failures to assume control in the abandoned FARC territories.

" Colombia’s healthcare is collapsing partly because 93% of President Ivan Duque’s $1.5 billion (COP8.2 trillion) financial injection to confront COVID-19 never arrived.Investigative journalism website Cuestion Publica reported Thursday that the Finance Ministry transferred less than $110 million of the promised investment that sought to bolster healthcare to the Health Ministry and the National Health Institute.What exactly this money was spent on is not entirely clear as “the Economic Transparency website [of the Finance Ministry] “has a limited scope into the details of the information that can be found regarding outsourcing,” Andres Hernandez of Transparency Colombia told Cuestion Publica.Coronavirus: Colombia to inject $1.5B in healthcare and secure food for 10 million during quarantineThe missing $414 millionMore than $414 million (COP1.5 billion) promised to the National Disaster Prevention and Response Unit is unaccounted for as it was transferred to an obscure trust fund called the Fiduprevisora that has failed to make its financial records public.Opposition Senator Juan Luis Castro (Green Alliance), a physician, told Cuestion Publica he was particularly concerned about this transfer of money to this trust fund, claiming it has a history of mismanaging funds meant for healthcare for teachers and inmates.“If they can’t function under normal conditions, they would be even more useless in a situation that is extremely delicate like this one,” according to Castro.The investigative journalists requested Fiduprevisora’s financial records, but received no response.Most COVID-19 money went to banksThe $1.5 billion financial injection promised to the health sector is part of a total of an $8 billion (COP29 trillion) emergency budget of which only $996 million (COP3.6 billion) was effectively used, the Javeriana University said last month.The university verified the execution of the promised COVID-19 policies and found that more than $636 million of the $996 million had gone to banks.At the time, healthcare workers were already combating an increase in patients despite not having been paid for months.By Wednesday, COVID-19 collapsed the hospitals in Bogota, leaving the capital city of 7 million without healthcare.Hospitals in the historically neglected south of the country and along the Pacific coast had collapsed weeks before that already. coronavirusexecutive order ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-healthcare-collapsing-as-duques-1-5b-injection-promise-turns-out-93-hot-air/,Colombia’s healthcare collapsing as Duque’s $1.5B injection promise turns out 93% hot air

" Colombia’s far-right ruling party didn’t just engage in cyberwarfare against journalists, but also the country’s war crimes tribunal, according to newspaper El Espectador.The newspaper found that regional executives and lawmakers of President Ivan Duque’s Democratic Center (CD) party have also been targeting the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) in coordinated disinformation campaigns on Twitter.The cyberwarfare that sought to discredit the JEP began around the same time the so-called “sweatshop” of supporters of Duque’s controversial political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe began attacking journalists.How Colombia’s government officials led a political warfare campaign against journalistsEl Espectador found that of the 10 most popular hashtags featuring the JEP, seven were introduced and promoted by one regional party executive and lawmakers of the CD.The hashtags of the so-called “Uribista sweatshop” targeting the JEP  bombarded the social media platform with more than 35,000 Tweets between August 29 last year and June 30 of this year.Of the almost 9,000 accounts taking part in these campaigns, 31% appeared to be bots programmed to replicate views of the ruling party’s leading members and their most fanatic supporters.The seven hashtags were about “breaking” or “eliminating” the JEP, linking the war crimes tribunal to terrorism or impunity, or promoting “news” websites associated with the party or publishing disinformation.“These propaganda strategies, as I would call them, do not promote a dialogue between informed citizens,” Javeriana University professor Andres Lombana told El Espectador.‘I don’t know when, but I know I’m going to die, honorable magistrates’The main promoters of the campaigns, Valle del Cauca party director Jaime Arizabaleta and former Senate candidate Ana María Abello, denied knowing fake accounts were boosting their campaigns.Senator Carlos Felipe Mejia wouldn’t respond.A spokesperson of the war crimes tribunal, Hernando Salazar, said he is aware that “there are repetitive messages and accounts that are dedicated to systematically trying to undermine the credibility” of the JEP, but hardly seemed impressed.The war crimes tribunal, which took force last year as part of a peace process agreed upon between former President Juan Manuel Santos and demobilized FARC guerrillas, has been opposed by Duque and his party in all forms, but without success.

" Colombia’s defense ministry has been reporting inflated statistics on the forced eradication of coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, multiple counternarcotics officials told weekly Semana.Eight civilian eradicators and counternarcotics officials confirmed the fraud that reportedly has been going on for at least 10 years and is known by the United States embassy.Colombia’s defense ministry told Semana it “has not detected any allegedly false reports in relation to the 2019 eradication,” but was contradicted by one of its own officials.The economic and human costs are barbaric, and the only way to justify them is to inflate results.Defense ministry officialMeeting targets without resultsPresident Ivan Duque (L) and his US counterpart Donald Trump (Image: President’s Office)The forced eradication statistics are reportedly inflated to guarantee that targets set by Bogota and Washington DC are met, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is given manipulated statistics.Furthermore, the fraud serves to justify the enormous cost of the notoriously ineffective counternarcotics efforts that cost American and Colombian tax payers $100 million (COP361 billlion) last year alone, the anonymous sources told Semana.According to an anonymous defense ministry official, the politicians’ fixation on targets is the cause of all evil.If the minister says that 50,000 must be eradicated this year, 50,000 must be eradicated no matter how. That’s the mistake, the no matter how. We had the perception that the measurement was not accurate, that if there was a target, this was what would be reported.National Army counternarcotics officialColombia vows to eradicate a record 130,000 hectares of coca this yearHow the books are cookedPresident Ivan Duque and US Ambassador Philip Goldberg visit a seemingly staged cocaine lab (Image: President’s Office)The security officials and civilian contractors involved in eradication told Semana they used several tricks to cook the books.The fraud allows them to meet daily and monthly targets set by their superiors in Bogota, but also allows the Defense Ministry to report fraudulent statistics to the UNODC.Trick #1: partial eradicationAn eradicator told the magazine that, for example, police and coca farmers agreed only half of the crops would be eradicated, allowing the counternarcotics unit to falsely claim they finished their eradication operation while the farmers were allowed to keep half their coca.The community was pissed off because they were going to eradicate, so a [Police] lieutenant came to talk to the people. They agreed that, for every hectare, 25 percent would be cut above the trunk and the peasants themselves would cut them. Twenty-five percent was uprooted and that was for the photo, to say that 100 hectares were eradicated. And 50 percent was left untouched.EradicatorThis practice was confirmed by the anonymous counternarcotics expert.The police are more sophisticated in the process. They tell the coca growers: “You have 100 hectares, we are going to eradicate 50.” The Army does it too, but not that much. And so the community doesn’t confront them. So, they report an area that was only partially eradicated as cleared. And the next year, when the area again appears to have coca, they say that it was planted again, which is nonsense.Counternarcotics expertTrick #2: inventing eradicationThe same eradicator told Semana that in December 2018, before he was sent to Putumayo, he took part in an eradication operation in the southwestern Nariño province. In that operation, eradicators allegedly reported grasslands and plots that had already been eradicated to meet the allegedly impossible target of eradicating 300 hectares in 35 days.In 35 days, the most they could possibly remove is 100 hectares. In that phase in Tumaco, they reported grasslands, and crops that they had eradicated a few months before. It was a disaster.EradicatorTrick #3: Mobile cultivationEradicator at work (Image: President’s Office)The eradicator said that they also used a trick called “mobile cultivation” while he was on the eradication missions in Tumaco in December 2018 and Putumayo in June last year.The mobile cultivation trick consists of uprooting coca on one plot and then planting it again on a nearby plot. The empty plot would then be photographed and the coordinates sent to Bogota for verification via satellite.“The important thing was that the bushes were not left with the leaves turned over because the United Nations verified the photo,” the eradicator told Semana.Trick #4: Falsifying dataA general working for the defense ministry, a former police investigator and an eradicator said that eradication teams also send false or inflated geographical data to Bogota, taking advantage of the fact that the presence of illegal armed groups makes verification impossible.They report a much larger perimeter as eradicated than actually had crops. The one who does the measurements walks with the GPS to areas where there was no coca.Police investigatorThe UNODC’s verification method using satellite imagery additionally allows security forces to report the eradication after the UN agency had gathered its satellite data for its annual report.This allows the defense ministry to report inflated eradication numbers without verification late in the year.When President Ivan Duque was under pressure from Washington last year, for example, eradication in December went up 168% to 12,600 hectares compared to the same month in 2018. It then dropped to 2,366 hectares in January.Reported coca eradication per monthSource: Defense MinistryThe nine deaths and 60 injuries reported by Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo are likely deflated as his predecessor, Guillermo Botero, reported 12 killed officials and 85 injuries in October last year.In total, 10,400 soldiers and 1,883 policemen are currently involved in manual eradication operations, according to Semana.UN improving verification methods to counter fraudA UNODC official told Semana they have been working to improve the verification of eradication data provided by the government “to ensure an objective and verifiable validation” after noticing anomalies in 2018.Colombia’s security forces began manually eradicating coca under former President Alvaro Uribe in 2005 after which potential cocaine production went from 640 tons to a record 1,137 tons last year.Colombia’s potential cocaine productionSource: UNODCCounternarcotics experts and the UNODC have dismissed forced eradication as ineffective for years, but neither Washington DC nor Bogota have shown interest in effectively reducing cocaine production through crop substitution and economic development. coca cultivationDrug policydrug traffickingnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-great-drug-war-swindle/,Colombia’s great drug war swindle
" Colombia’s defense minister said Monday the government is ready to resume the aerial fumigation of coca after local media reported that forced eradication statistics were inflated.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told press that “we have taken all the steps demanded by the Constitutional Court and are meeting the requirements of the authorities” to resume the controversial counternarcotics strategy that was banned in 2015.The Justice Ministry made similar claims in January and President Ivan Duque said in June last year that the National Army and the police would resume aerial spraying “within weeks.”Colombia announces resumption of aerial fumigation of coca, againThe security forces haven’t been able to aerially fumigate one square inch, because the court demands the government prioritizes crop substitution, which has virtually come to a halt, and receive consent of communities who oppose aerial fumigation over health concerns.Trujillo wouldn’t say when he would resume aerial fumigation, but had to come up with something after Semana reported that the statistics on forced eradication of coca, the base ingredient for cocaine, were being inflated.Colombia’s great drug war swindleThe report put the defense minister in the corner as Trujillo promised US Defense Secretary Mark Esper in February to forcibly eradicate 130,000 hectares of coca this year, 40% more than the country’s all-time record.The defense minister said that the security forces had forcibly eradicated 45,000 hectares up to July 12, almost twice as much as the 26,466 hectares the Defense Ministry said to have eradicated between January and May.While Trujillo failed to resume aerial fumigation and continue crop substitution, and reportedly presented fraudulent forced eradication statistics, Colombia’s narcos have been doing better than ever, according to the UNODC.The country’s potential cocaine production went up 1.5% to 1,137 metric tons between 2018 and 2019, almost 10 times as much as in 1993, the year US and Colombian authorities celebrated the killing of late drug lord Pablo Escobar. aerial fumigationcoca cultivationDrug policydrug traffickingnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-vows-to-resume-aerial-fumigation-of-coca-for-the-3rd-time-in-a-year/,Colombia vows to resume aerial fumigation of coca (for the 3rd time in a year)
" Instead of investigating a powerful banker over his alleged role in the Odebrecht bribery scandal, Colombia’s prosecution is defending him, according to newspaper El Espectador.A judge ordered the investigation of Grupo Aval CEO Luis Carlos Sarmiento Jr. last year after multiple witnesses said the banker had been informed about the bribery practices of Brazilian engineering firm Odebrecht and Grupo Aval subsidiary Corficolombiana.Prosecutor Daniel Hernandez reportedly said that the Odebrecht executives who were involved in the bribery practices in Colombia “had no information that compromised” Sarmiento and his father, Colombia’s richest man.Judge wants son of Colombia’s richest man investigated in Odebrecht probeOh, it’s Hernandez againProsecutor Daniel Hernandez (Image: W Radio)Why Hernandez is investigating Odebrecht is a mystery; former special prosecutor Leonardo Espinosa reportedly filed criminal charges against the prosecutor and his colleague, Alvaro Betancur, last year for frustrating the investigation.The allegedly corrupt prosecutor recently ordered to jail police investigators who discovered a conspiracy between the mafia and Colombia’s ruling party to rig the 2018 elections and is also implicated in a corporate spying scandal.According to investigative journalist Gonzalo Guillen, Hernandez and Betancur are henchmen of Nestor Humberto Martinez, who was Grupo Aval’s judicial adviser until he became Colombia’s Prosecutor General in 2016.Colombia’s 10 top corporations, or mafia organizations?Prosecution contradicting witnessesJorge Enrique PizanoLuis Antonio Bueno, Odebrecht’s former top dog in Colombia, testified last year that former Corficolombiana CEO Gustavo Ramirez told the Brazilian businessman he would inform Sarmiento Jr in 2009.When still working for Grupo Aval, Martinez told the late auditor of Grupo Aval and Odebrecht’s Ruta del Sol II project, Jorge Enrique Pizano, that he would inform Sarmiento Sr. in August 2015.As chief prosecutor, Martinez kept things under the rug until the US Department of Justice revealed Odebrecht had engaged in corruption in Colombia in late 2017.The Supreme Court appointed a special prosecutor after the suspicious deaths of Pizano and his son in 2018 and the release of a 2017 interview with Noticias Uno. The auditor asked it not to be released until after he was in a US witness protection program or in case he died.The prosecution reportedly ransacked the special prosecutor’s office after the special prosecutor suddenly was made redundant due to the surprise resignation of Martinez in May last year.Grupo Aval bankrolled the 2018 campaign of President Ivan Duque, who is implicated in the Odebrecht scandal and earlier this year endorsed the election of chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa.

" Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero said on Monday that Colombia’s second largest city will shut down again on Friday to prevent the collapse of the city’s healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.The four-day lockdown is the first in Colombia’s second largest city since President Ivan Duque began relaxing his March 25 lockdown in late April.Medellin’s city center locked down on Monday already after the acting governor declared an orange alert over the rapid saturation of hospitals in the Antioquia province, Colombia’s second largest economy after the capital Bogota.To prevent a collapse of the city’s hospitals, which would deprive Medellin of any healthcare, Quintero said he is seeking  to shut down the city four days a week.Following this weekend’s shutdown, which coincides with a bank holiday because of Colombia’s Independence Day, Medellin’s mayor will initially only shut down the city on weekends.Quintero is said to have coordinated the first shut down with the government of President Ivan Duque, but seemingly has yet to convince the national government to approve weekly shutdowns.Against the advice of Colombia’s medical community and economists, Duque tried to gradually reactivate the economy while the coronavirus was far from under control.Economists and healthcare organizations have urged the president to implement an emergency basic income that would allow a reactivation of the economy without putting the country’s healthcare system at risk.Duque’s economic reactivation plan spurred an acceleration of COVID-19 cases that now threatens to collapse healthcare in the country’s capital Bogota and major cities like Medellin and Cali.Healthcare in major port cities like Barranquilla and Buenaventura, and historically neglected regions in the south of the country has already collapsed.In his daily COVID show on Facebook, the president ignored the growing threat of a healthcare collapse and claimed that “the country’s COVID-19 indices continue to improve.” AntioquiacoronavirusMedellin ",https://colombiareports.com/covid-19-in-colombia-medellin-announces-weekly-lockdowns-to-prevent-healthcare-collapse/,COVID-19 in Colombia: Medellin announces weekly lockdowns to prevent healthcare collapse
" Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez called on residents of Colombia’s capital for solidarity on Sunday to “overcome what we’ll go through” ahead of the projected peak of the coronavirus pandemic.Despite her city’s almost saturated hospitals, Lopez said she was optimistic Bogota’s healthcare system won’t collapse as the pandemic is expected to hit the capital in full force in the coming two months.To slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the critical weeks ahead, half of Bogota will be on lockdown from Monday on in an experimental rotating lockdown system.Burying the hatchet with DuqueThe mayor also openly highlighted cooperation with Health Minister Fernando Ruiz, with whom she has clashed on multiple occasions over the past months.The make-up was an apparent attempt to jointly confront what could be the most challenging months both for Lopez and President Ivan Duque, and governability in general.Largest cities in Colombia reverse reopening as coronavirus threatens to collapse healthcareMedical organizations all but optimisticMedical organizations were considerably less optimistic than the mayor about the resilience of Bogota’s public healthcare system that has suffered from historical neglect.Bogota’s healthcare secretary said Sunday that almost 90% of the city’s intensive care units (ICU’s) are full.Additionally, the government’s failure to provide personal protection equipment to healthcare personnel has dramatically reduced the number of intensivists and registered nurses that could take care of critically ill patients, according to Bogota Medical College director Herman Bedoya.The physical capacity can be multiplied, but the same does not apply to intensivists, specialists and care staff. In anticipation, we expanded the staff as much as possible. In both ways, we trained and retrained the medical and care staff available to deal with the peak of the pandemic when we get there.Bogota Medical College director Herman Bedoya.The president of the Medical Association of intensive care, Jose Luis Accini, was considerably more concerned about a possible collapse and said they have been training personnel to make sure there are people to run the extra ICU’s and ventilators.However, horrible labor conditions are depleting as personnel have walked out, fallen ill or have been forced into quarantine, said Accini.According to the INS, Bogota has registered almost 50,000 confirmed cases since early March, almost one third of the entire country.Of these people, 1,123 have died.  Bogotaclaudia lopezcoronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/bogota-mayor-calls-for-solidarity-to-overcome-what-well-go-through-during-covid-19-peak/,Bogota mayor calls for solidarity to ‘overcome what we’ll go through’ during COVID-19 peak
" One of Colombia’s most influential radio hosts, Julio Sanchez who used to be an ally of legendary anti-mafia politician Luis Carlos Galan, has started doing lip service for former members of the Medellin Cartel.The current boss of W Radio began his career supporting Galan, who opposed the cartel’s influence in politics until cartel founder Pablo Escobar ordered the politician’s assassination in 1989.But somewhere between then and now, Sanchez appears to have changed sides.Colombia’s mafia and the media | Part 1: Vicky DavilaFrom anti-mafia advocate to mafia apologistThe W Radio director in 2007 was accused of receiving bribes to favor Medellin Cartel co-founder Fabio Ochoa and being friends with former cartel drug trafficker Carlos Ramon Zapata, a.k.a. “El Medico.”This year alone, journalist Gonzalo Guillen exposed Sanchez for conspiring with alleged money launder Jaime Lombana, a defense attorney of another former cartel associate, former President Alvaro Uribe.Additionally, a television series based on Sanchez’s book caused indignation because it showed Galan and late Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara, who was killed by cartel assassins in 1984, expressing sympathy for Escobar.Luis Carlos Galan and Rodrigo Lara gave their lives fighting against drug trafficking, against corruption and against the corrupt Liberal Party and drug traffickers, terrorists, entering politics to take over the power of the State and the domination of society.Senator Ivan MarulandaThe aftermath of Operation MilleniumFabio OchoaWhat happened with the W Radio host after Galan’s death is unclear.What is clear is that Ochoa and El Medico were extradited to the United States after “Operation Millenium,” a counternarcotics operation led by DEA agent Minh T. Nguyen.A US judge sentenced Ochoa to 30 years in prison on drug trafficking charges in 2003 based on the testimony of key witness “Juvenal,” a former associate who had become a DEA informant after his 1999 arrest.The Medellin Cartel founder tried to overturn his 30-year sentence and was allegedly using the W Radio host to discredit the DEA’s key witness.Juvenal wrote US prosecutor Ricarco del Toro, who was confronting Ochoa in court, that Nguyen had warned him that the W Radio was on the Ochoa family’s payroll and, together with El Medico, were trying to trick the DEA’s key witness into undermining the 2003 testimony that got the Medellin Cartel founder put behind bars in the US.Minh emphatically told me that this was one of the reasons that journalist Julio Sanchez Cristo, one of the best Colombian journalists, wanted to interview me, and that the Ochoa family was giving money to Julio Sanchez Cristo so that he would interview me and get different information from me than what I had said before so that he could catch me in an inaccuracy or contradiction in my testimony in the trial. The Ochoas would jump on this to ask for a new trial for Fabio and dismiss me as a witness for having lied or given false testimony. And this, Ricardo, is very delicate because only I know the kilos that Fabio Ochoa brought on each route or flight. I informed Carlos Ramon, who is Julio Sanchez Cristo’s friend, that I could not give him the interview. And agent Minh also spoke with Carlos Ramon about this.Ochoa’s attempt for a retrial failed and he was forced to remain in prison. El Medico and Juvenal were released a few years later, but both soon encountered bad luck.Sanchez and “El Medico”Carlos Ramon Zapata, a.k.a. “El Medico”El Medico was arrested again in 2011 on fraud, robbery and money laundering charges and went back to prison.Juvenal returned to Colombia and was assassinated near Bogota in 2012.In an interview, El Medico told Sanchez from his US prison in 2018 that he had falsely testified against the Medellin Cartel founder.The journalist repeated the Medellin Cartel founder’s discarded claim that Ochoa never talked to Juvenal about drugs, but “about women and horses.”Sanchez had become so friendly with El Medico he called him by his first name, claiming the mafioso was in prison “over other issues that have to do with his labor activities, the business or the businesses he had in the United States.”According to Blu Radio, El Medico left prison in 2019 and has since been in exile in the United States.The W Radio boss is waiting for Guillen to finish his book about Sanchez, who began as an anti-mafia advocate and ended up embroiled with two narcos and an alleged money launderer. journalismJulio Sanchezmedianarcojournalism ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-mafia-and-the-media-part-3-julio-sanchez/,Colombia’s mafia and the media | Part 3: Julio Sanchez

" After independent media revealed evidence of ties between #Colombia’s ruling party and the mafia, the country’s corporate television networks were quick to cover this up.The news programs of RCN Television and Caracol dedicated not even a second to the scandal that led opposition Senator Gustavo Petro to call President Ivan Duque’s 2018 election “illegitimate.”Noticias RCN: blaming guerrillas for everythingThe most striking misinformation came from Noticias RCN, which reported that dissident FARC guerrillas’ alleged increased cultivation of coca was the main cause of deforestation in the central Meta province.This claim by the governor is contradicted by environmental authorities that say that cattle farming and peasants’ need for land are the main causes of deforestation in the area.Coca cultivation in the area has been going down, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.RCN omitted the evidence that the regional chief of far-right Democratic Center party had been celebrating Duque’s allegedly fraudulent 2018 election with the mafia.Instead, the television network broadcast the president talking about “the swindlers of neo-Chavism who want to go out in our nations to sow chaos and ride on the discourse of chaos to their nefarious attempts to assume power.”RCN didn’t even say who the allegedly illegitimate president was talking about.Instead of focusing on the flurry of criticism about Duque’s controversial and chaotic response to the pandemic, RCN blamed visibly starving citizens’ “irresponsibility” and “lack of discipline” on an accelerated increase in infections.Colombia news anchor scorned after claiming media ‘are not to inform or anything’Caracol Noticias’ stigmatization of journalistsCaracol Noticias focused mainly on the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing government officials to promote the government’s controversial attempt to reopen the economy the health organizations blame for the growing crisis.Caracol called on citizens to follow government guidelines to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system.Health organizations, on the contrary, have consistently blamed Duque and his Health Minister Fernando Ruiz of collapsing the healthcare system by reopening the economy without providing personal protection equipment to medical personnel.The television news network dedicated the rest of its broadcast to local incidents and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez’s visit to US President Donald Trump.Without mentioning the narcopolitics scandal, co-anchor Maria Camila Orozco said Duque’s attack was against people who “exacerbated public sentiment in the country.”The television network’s cherry on the pie was its environmental segment  on environmental authorities’ rescue of a cute baby tiger cat that was sponsored by EPM, the culprit of one of Colombia’s worst environmental disasters in recent memory.  journalismmediapropaganda ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-television-news-pimping-journalism-with-elegant-propaganda/,Colombia’s television news: pimping journalism with elegant propaganda
" Colombia’s ruling party sank deeper in crisis on Wednesday after the release of a wiretap recording of a regional chief celebrating the 2018 election of President Ivan Duque with a late narco associate.“We got a fucking president,” the Democratic Center’s regional director in Santander, Ivan Aguilar, told Jose Guillermo Hernandez in the wiretap recording released by newspaper La Nueva Prensa.“We got a president and we got friends,” the late money launderer of the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa also known as “El Ñeñe” confirmed.“The president called me four days ago”Late mafia boss Jose Guillermo Hernandez (R) and President Ivan Duque. (Image: La Nueva Prensa)The money launderer additionally told the party executive that “the president called me four days ago” in the wiretap reportedly recorded two weeks after Duque’s election.Wiretaps from before the election revealed that Figueroa’s money launderer conspired with the Democratic Center to commit fraud in the second round.These wiretaps triggered a Supreme Court investigation against former President Alvaro Uribe, a Congressional investigation against Duque and a prosecution investigation against party executives and aides.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersDuque’s party increasingly in troubleThe wiretaps from before the elections revealed El Ñeñe’s intentions to help Duque win the elections in the Caribbean provinces of La Guajira, Magdalena and Cesar.The latest recording reveal that the money launderer was also close to the regional Democratic Party chief in Santander where El Ñeñe promised a different member of the Aguilar Clan he would also get votes.The election fraud plot was coincidentally discovered by agents of police intelligence unit DIJIN who were wiretapping “El Ñeñe” as part of a homicide investigation.This investigation ended in May last year when the mafia figure was killed during an alleged robbery in Brazil. 2018 electionselection fraudIvan AguilarIvan DuqueJose Guillermo Hernandez ",https://colombiareports.com/we-got-a-president-and-we-got-friends-mafia-to-colombias-ruling-party/,‘We got a president and we got friends’: mafia to Colombia’s ruling party
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque introduced “neo-Chavism” and former President Alvaro Uribe coined “pre-Chavism” as the latest imaginary political threat to their power on Wednesday.Duque warned regional counterparts of the Andean Presidential Council about “the swindlers of neo-Chavism who want to go out and sow chaos in our nations, and ride on the discourse of chaos to their nefarious attempts to assume power.”The “neo-communist enchanter”The president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, warned about a “pre-chavist atmosphere” that would benefit a “neo-communist enchanter” to win Colombia’s 2022 elections.You have to be very careful with the ‘neo-communist enchanter’ because the ‘neo-communist enchanter’ hates being called a communist, that’s been erased. They come across as democrats and only talk about equality and transparency, and what they do is destroy private enterprise and leave countries without resources for social policy.Former President Alvaro Uribe“Chavism” refers to the socialist thought of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who was elected to power in Venezuela in 1999 after major social unrest and stayed in power in an increasingly authoritarian fashion until his death in 2013.“Neo-communist” is a term that was coined in the early 20th century to describe a “proponent or adherent of a new or revived form of communism, especially a form adapted to address local or contemporary conditions and issues,” according to the Oxford Dictionary,Duque’s damaged legitimacySenator Ciro Ramirez indicated that “pro-Chavism” referred to opposition Senator Gustavo Petro, who called Duque an “illegitimate president” on Sunday and called for civil disobedience on Monday.Petro lost the 2018 elections against the president, but mounting evidence that Uribe’s far-right Democratic Center party conspired with narcos to rig the elections brought the opposition candidate to retract his recognition of the results.The “pro-Chavez” campaign that today wants to incite the country to civil disobedience, to anarchy, will be defeated in 2022. This destructive opposition that today wants to launch the opposition to President Duque is going out of control, abandoning democracy and is the one that Colombians are punishing.Senator Ciro Ramirez“Uribistas” clearly nervousWhile Petro’s claim that he won the 2018 elections received no support from other parties, the “Uribistas” are clearly nervous over criminal investigations initiated by the Supreme Court, Congress and the prosecution.The opposition politician has had nothing to do with the journalistic investigations that revealed the Democratic Center’s mafia ties or the criminal investigations that followed.Petro has just been adding fuel to the fire that is slowly roasting the unpopular president, and his controversial political patron and party. 2018 electionsAlvaro UribeDemocratic Centerelection fraudIvan Duquenarcopolitics ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-latest-political-threat-pre-chavism-or-neo-chavism/,Colombia’s latest political ghost threat: ‘pre-Chavism’ or ‘neo-Chavism’?
" Colombia’s former chief prosecutor said Wednesday he has the evidence to see former President Alvaro Uribe convicted for two massacres.In an interview with Semana, former Prosecutor General Eduardo Montealegre said he and his former deputy, Jorge Perdomo, are able to prove Uribe was involved in the El Aro and La Granja massacres when the far-right political patron of President Ivan Duque was governor of the Antioquia province in the late 1990’s.Uribe tried to frame Montealegre and Perdomo while on trial on fraud and bribery charges last year, claiming they were conspiring against him, but failed.The former chief prosecutor, who was ordered to investigate the massacres when he was in office between 2012 and 2016, continued the investigations and told Semana he will go to court as soon as the Supreme Court, which is closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, reopens.Despite evidence Uribe has been involved in organized crime since before 1980 when his friends of the Ochoa crime family founded the Medellin Cartel, the far-right politician has evaded justice, but his time is up, Perdomo told Semana.Uribe’s time has come to answer to justice. During his long political career, he has gotten away with all the crimes he has committed. He remained in impunity, he has managed to evade justice, but his time has come. Uribe is a war criminal.Former chief prosecutor Eduardo MontealegreUribe called Montealegre a liar on Twitter and said his alleged involvement had been “totally disproven,” contradicting the court order to investigate the former president.Duque’s political patron has come under increasing legal pressure over the past years.Since 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the investigation of  Uribe for allegedly manipulating witnesses who had testified he had co-founded a death squad, received illegally obtained intelligence reports on critics from the National Army and ordered election fraud to secure the election of the president.

" The archbishop of Cali sparked a fierce debate after accusing Colombia’s President Ivan Duque of taking “genocidal revenge” against social leaders supporting the country’s peace process.The Colombian Catholic Church distanced itself from Archbishop Dario Monsalve, who accused Duque of a “genocidal revenge to completely dismember society, social organizations and democracy in the fields and in the territories.”Monsalve made the comments over the president’s failure to act against the mass killing of human rights defenders and community leaders’ lives since the 2016 peace deal.According to conflict monitoring NGO Indepaz, at least 159 social leaders and 25 demobilized members of the FARC have been assassinated.Killing of social leaders in ColombiaSource: IndepazThe rejection of the Church and the government sparked a major support campaign for Monsalve, particularly from the organizations who have suffered the violence that has attracted the attention of the United Nations’  genocide prevention chief.Indigenous and Afrocolombian organizations from the southwest of the country said Monsalve’s harsh criticism of the president and his far-right Democratic Center party “reflect how the communities in the Pacific and other regions think and feel.”Statement by ethnic minoritiesDuque’s government and his party have been faithful to their electoral campaign of “shattering the peace agreement” by attacking the different mechanisms agreed upon (the war crimes tribunal, the Truth Commission, the unit for the search of disappeared persons) and drastically weakening its implementation in the areas of integral rural reform, substitution of illicit crops, protection of communities, dismantling of paramilitary structures and integral reincorporation of former combatants of the extinct FARC-EP. The communities in many territories of the Pacific and Southwest that suffer from the worsening of the armed conflict are subjected to genocide, as the painful figures show: since the signing of the peace agreement, more than 460 social leaders and human rights defenders have been murdered, as well as 216 ex-combatants and signatories of the peace agreement. The physical extermination of the indigenous peoples, reflected in the assassination of 167 indigenous leaders during the government of President Duque, is notorious. The planting of “Peace with Legality” is a deceptive discourse, since it governs illegality in peripheral territories even more strongly. The refusal to accept the existence of an armed conflict that must be solved through negotiation is clear. Meanwhile, there is a kind of revenge against our territories that we continue to bet on negotiated peace.” Duque has always claimed to be living up to his obligations, despite constant efforts to alter or obstruct the peace process.The president’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, has continued to refer to human rights defenders as terrorists while Uribe and many members of his party have been linked to organized crime and crimes against humanity that could be exposed during the peace process.

" Colombia’s chief prosecutor is under fire again over his alleged abuse of power to bully critics of his long-time friend, President Ivan Duque, instead of fighting crime.Some 60 political and judicial heavyweights sent a letter to Duque after Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa ordered the confiscation of properties belonging to Magdalena Governor Carlos Caicedo and former Mayor Rafael Martinez.According to the leading politicians and judicial experts, Barbosa’s latest controversial move is “a new attack against those of us who think differently and who dispute the policies of the national government.”“No criminal conduct can be inferred from the actions of the former mayors,” the politicians and jurists wrote the president. The Prosecutor General’s Office is being used as a hammer against alternative governments and democratic personalities such as those who are now suffering this unjust outrage, and it is you, as Head of State and Head of Government, who must guarantee the freedoms and human rights of citizens.Political leaders and juristsThe Magdalena governor pointed out that, according to the prosecution, he had bought his mom’s home in 1995 with money allegedly embezzled between 2015 and 2019.It seems that the national level of government is interested in hindering the mandate and taking over the spaces that ought to be managed by the new administration of the Magdalena, without the traditional family clans that have misruled the department in recent years, leaving deep gaps of inequality, poverty, institutional precariousness and fiscal deterioration.Political leaders and juristsThe letter of former acting Mayor of Bogota, Clara Lopez was signed by, among others, former Constitutional Court magistrates Alfredo Beltran, Jorge Ivan Palacio and Luis Ernesto Vargas, former Central Bank executive Salomon Kalmanovitz, former Nariño governor Camilo Romero and much of the congressional opposition.The Prosecutor General justified confiscating the former mayors’ properties on the claim that only one of five hospitals they had been constructing was finished.“A visit to the city is enough to corroborate that four of them were delivered and are currently in operation,” Caicedo said, adding that the properties were seized without the approval of a judge.Barbosa has been under almost constant criticism for trumping up charges against government critics like Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez while neglecting and allegedly frustrating investigations into major corruption scandals like the Odebrecht bribery scandal and alleged election fraud in the 2018 elections.

" Colombia’s State Council is studying a writ to nullify the election of controversial chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa, claiming that President Ivan Duque’s friend disrupts the balance of powers.The writ was filed by two law students who want the country’s highest administrative court to define fixed periods for a chief prosecutor that prevent the accumulation of executive and judicial power.The balance of powersUntil 2010, the Supreme Court would elect a Prosecutor General from a presidential shortlist in the last year of his mandate, effectively preventing the merger of powers.Due to the premature departure of two chief prosecutors, Duque was able to have his friend elected at the beginning of his four years in office.Since his election, Barbosa has been accused of blocking an investigation into fraud in the elections of Duque and members of his far-right Democratic Center party, while embarking on a political persecution of critics.This “is not in harmony with our judicial and constitutional order” that seeks to “guarantee the balance of powers,” according to the writ.The election [of Francisco Barbosa] carried out in these terms by the Full Chamber of the Supreme Court directly violates the 1991 Political Constitution.Gina Paola Avila and Rene Mateus ForeroIn order to reestablish the balance of powers, the law students asked the State Council to declare the election of Barbosa null and void, and establish a fixed period that prevents a president to control the prosecution.How the balance of powers were disruptedThe balance of powers began being disrupted when the Supreme Court failed to elect a Prosecutor General from former President Alvaro Uribe’s shortlist in 2010.The court did accept the shortlist of Uribe’s successor, President Juan Manuel Santos, and elected Viviana Morales as chief prosecutor in December of that year, effectively aligning the executive branch and the Prosecutor General’s Office.The State Council declared Morales’ election null and void in 2012 because the court lacked the sufficient number of magistrates at the time of the vote.A writ demanding that the time in office of her successor, Eduardo Montealegre, would not be for four years, but until the end of Morales’ term was denied by the administrative court in 2013.Consequently, Santos was allowed to endorse a new chief prosecutor in 2016, which became Nestor Humberto Martinez.Martinez resigned in May last year 2019 after the war crimes tribunal ordered an investigation into alleged abuse of power, forcing another premature election.A group of Supreme Court magistrates had begun blocking votes, which threatened to leave the court without the necessary number of seats to elect anyone.The court elected Barbosa from Duque’s shortlist just before running out of seats again early this year.

" A judge gave Colombia’s President Ivan Duque 48 hours to suspend the participation of American troops in counternarcotics operations.The US sent 53 soldiers of a so-called Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) to Colombia on June 1 to assist Colombia’s military in counternarcotics operations in war-torn areas.According to the judge, the government failed to ask permission from Congress before allowing foreign soldiers to carry out operations inside the country, making the US mission illegal.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told Congress he didn’t need such permission after which opposition Senator Ivan Cepeda took the matter to the Cundinamarca Administrative Tribunal.The judge ruled that if Trujillo wants the US soldiers to continue their operations he must either receive permission from Congress or successfully appeal the ruling within 72 hours.The decision is a major blow for the defense minister, who must now explain to the US embassy he messed up the bilateral operations because he forgot to obey the law.Trujillo, whose father was openly praised by late drug lord Pablo Ecobar, was already under pressure over his failure to effectively reduce cocaine production.Congress has demanded the defense minister implement the counternarcotics element of a 2016 peace deal with the FARC, which prioritizes crop substitution.The White House has been pushing for a more hard-line approach, including the aerial fumigation of coca.The defense minister is doing neither of these and additionally has been ordered to end joint forced eradication operations.Apart from that, Trujillo’s promise to US Defense Secretary Mark Esper to increase the forced eradication of coca to a record 130,000 hectares this year is falling apart.Instead of increasing this notoriously ineffective strategy with 40%, the Defense Ministry reported a 30% drop in forcibly eradicated hectares of coca in the first four months of the year.Meanwhile, potential cocaine production reached a new record level in 2019, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. counternarcoticsdrug traffickingIvan DuqueUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/judge-gives-duque-48-hours-to-suspend-us-military-operations-in-colombia/,Judge gives Duque 48 hours to suspend US military operations in Colombia

Based on the above, authorities in charge of the operation proceeded to take samples, which were sent to the laboratory where the existence and weight of the illegal substance was determined.Defense MinistryThis form of concealing the illicit substance is new and indicates how drug traffickers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their ability to mix cocaine with other substances and later extract the illicit drugs from the so-called host substance.The seizure is among one of the largest reported by Colombian authorities in recent years.According to the defense ministry, the police and the military last year were able to seize 433 metric tons of cocaine of the 1,137 metric tons that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated to be produced.

The president doesn’t have to go out to work, to go out in the street.”It’s very easy to say we can’t lock ourselves in when the only one who’s really been locked up is the president, everyone else has had to go out to work.Bogota Mayor Claudia LopezLopez’s snide remark was enough for the president to demonstrate bravery, leave the presidential palace and wear a mask for the second time in public since the coronavirus was first confirmed in Colombia on March 6.Duque’s failure to accurately count ventilators ruined his self-proclaimed act of patriotism and triggered even more mockery on social media. coronavirusIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/death-defying-duque-leaves-colombias-presidential-palace-for-first-time-in-months/,DEATH-DEFYING: Duque leaves Colombia’s presidential palace for first time in months

The people in government don’t know about them and the receiving banks have not been informed either,” one employer who asked to remain anonymous told Colombia Reports.A second employer said he did receive a loan and a stipend to pay employees, but that “the paperwork is crazy.”With the peak of the pandemic not expected until late August, it is still uncertain how many companies and jobs will still be standing and how fast economic activity can recover from what the International Monetary Fund considers the worst crash in Colombia’s history. coronaviruseconomic crisislaborunemployment ",https://colombiareports.com/unemployment-in-colombia-rises-further-despite-reopening-economy/,Unemployment in Colombia rises further despite reopening economy

" In a desperate attempt to evade responsibility, Colombia’s health minister blamed residents of the country’s largest Caribbean port city, Barranquilla, for the city’s collapse.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz rushed to the city on Friday to deliver 99 intensive care units after a scolding from the Inspector General’s Office that reported more than 1,000 of the city’s health workers were either infected or in quarantine.Inspector General runs out of patienceHealth workers at the Cari Mental hospital said that, apart from the city’s chronic lack of personal protection equipment, they haven’t been paid for three months.The situation represents serious risks for the guarantee of the public supply of health services in this region of the country, and demands immediate action to avert the associated epidemiological risks.Inspector General’s OfficeCarrillo gave Ruiz 48 hours to provide the city with the necessary equipment as 90% of their 446 ICU’s were full and the healthcare system was on the brink of collapse.Despite the minister’s last-minute action, Barranquilla pulmonologist Jorge Luis Quintero said the collapse of the city’s healthcare system was more a matter of when than if.We are at a point very close to collapse, we all know that we are on the verge of a calamitous situation.pulmonologist Jorge Luis QuinteroLocal authorities have halted President Ivan Duque’s attempts to reopen the country and imposed strict curfews to slow down further contagion.Much of the city is militarized, but enforcing a lockdown is becoming increasingly difficult as hundreds of policemen have been infected and tensions with the locals are rising.It is a tragedy what is happening in Barranquilla and Atlantico, with the reported number of infected and dead. The handling is wrong, militarizing the streets with soldiers and police and no social assistance, that is not the solution.Barranquilla residentDoctors contradict ministerRuiz refused to take responsibility for the crisis in the city whose almost 11,000 coronavirus infections represent 13% of cases in Colombia, but blamed the city’s residents for their lack of discipline.Quintero contradicted the minister and said that multiple factors have brought the city’s healthcare system to the brink of collapse, including the government’s failure to deliver equipment.We should consider that the problem of indiscipline is not the only one, it could also depend on the number of people per square meter, the number of comorbidities in the area. The same thing goes when the health system collapses and we don’t have the number of beds or care available. The moment the system is saturated you’re going to see dead peoplepulmonologist Jorge Luis QuinteroCOVID-19 infections in BarranquillaSource: National Health InstituteAt least 537 people have died in the city weeks ahead of the expected peak of the pandemic.Instead of taking responsibility, the minister returned to Bogota and claimed the city’s citizens lack of discipline for the excessive number of COVID-19 cases while joining President Ivan Duque for his daily COVID Facebook broadcast.Locals responded furiously, reminding the minister that the latest spike followed President Ivan Duque’s controversial plan to organize a tax-free shopping day in the middle of a pandemic.Others said that nobody answered the emergency number while others said staying at home is impossible without food.Put on your pants and accept your mistake. You are the ones to blame, you bunch of #”$$#%$”#$#%$.Twitter userPrisoners left without foodThe Inspector General sent out another warning on Saturday after getting wind that inmates at the local prison and jails weren’t receiving any food.Earlier in the week, the city was among multiple cities in the Caribbean region that suffered a blackout, further aggravating the situation in the hospitals.While the situation in Barranquilla is among the most serious in the country, the Colombian Medical College warned on Friday that between 40% and 60% of medical personal throughout Colombia are suffering burnouts.While Duque and Ruiz were pretending all was going well on Facebook, healthcare in the southwest of Colombia and the Pacific coast has all but collapsed and other cities on the Caribbean coast are in similar situations to Barranquilla.Also the capital Bogota has declared a yellow alert and has warned that once its hospital capacity reaches 75%, the city will go on lockdown again, ending Duque’s utterly chaotic attempt to restart the economy while coronavirus cases are accelerating.

" Accusations against Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero and Oscar nominee Ciro Guerra have revived a debate about widespread sexual harassment and abuse of women in Colombia.Feminist website Volcanicas received eight complaints over Guerra from women who said to either have been sexually harassed or abused by arguably the country’s top film producer of the moment.Quintero found himself accused of trying to censor media after newspaper El Espectador reported that one anonymous woman said she was sexually abused by the mayor and a second one said to have suffered sexual harassment.A collective working against sexual violence and discrimination in the entertainment industry, Rec Sisters, added Thursday that not even one of 147 colleagues they had polled said to not have suffered some form of sexual harassment at work.The guilty plea of seven soldiers who admitted to raping a 13-year-old girl further highlighted how Colombia’s women and girls are constantly under threat.Ciro GuerraCiro Guerra is the wonder-boy of Colombian cinema. Or at least he was until Thursday when seven women came forward with evidence of sexual harassment and one accusing him of sexual abuse. The guy started pulling down his pants, and he said, “I just want to see, let me see you” and I said, “No, no more, really, I don’t want to anymore”. And he pulled my arm and tried to kiss me, and I was no longer being conciliatory. Then he pushed me in the bedroom, I was on automatic pilot, in my panties, and he said: “Just a little, I’m not that asshole Hector, nothing’s wrong”. I was like, “Please don’t, please don’t.” I didn’t get angry like “motherfucking asshole” because I was scared, I got more tense and I didn’t let myself be touched anymore, and the guy looked at me strongly and put his finger in my vagina and said “a little bit, a little bit”. Then he took my hand and put it around his cock, and at that moment I felt like it wasn’t real what was happening, my arm was doing it but it was like it wasn’t mine. I felt like I had that feeling in my chest that you get when you get mugged.Anonymous womanThe woman accusing Guerra of sexual abuse said she was able to escape because she was able to call her boyfriend who rushed to pick her up.Other women published WhatsApp messages of the film director to back up their stories he had sexually harassed them.Following the publication of the testimonies, Guerra posted a video online saying the claims “are completely false” and vowed to file legal action against the women.Daniel QuinteroMedellin’s mayor got in trouble after a woman anonymously accused him of sexually abusing her at a party in 2017.According to the anonymous woman, she fell asleep at a party and woke up because the politician was on top of her masturbating. The woman said she asked Quintero to stop, which he wouldn’t until after he ejaculated over her.A second woman, who did reveal her name, said on Instagram and reiterated in interviews the Medellin Mayor sexually harassed her while she was working in a bar in 2016 until last week when she went quiet.Quintero told W Radio on Wednesday that “I have never harassed or abused anyone” after failed attempts to obstruct reports on the claims.According to press freedom foundation FLIP, the mayor asked the owners of newspaper El Espectador and W Radio to call back reporters after they unsuccessfully tried to get Quintero’s response.The W Radio reporters told FLIP there had been attempts to hack their social media accounts. Journalist Ana Cristina Restrepo said her weekly column, which would touch on the topic, didn’t make it to Medellin newspaper El Colombiano on time because of atypical issues with her email.The deafening silenceThe claims against Guerra and Quintero come after the #MeToo movement inspired several women to come forward to denounce they had been raped or sexually harassed.None of these claims have resulted in convictions or have even affected the careers of the men accused of sexual aggression or violence.In an attempt to defend women who were too afraid to speak out or file charges, journalist Claudia Morales admitted she had been raped, but said fear impeded her to say by who.While also receiving support, accusations Morales was seeking attention or sought to stain the reputation of her former employers made it painfully evident why many women remain silent about the widespread harassment and violence. newsletterSexual violenceviolence against womenwomen's rights ",https://colombiareports.com/oscar-nominee-ciro-guerra-and-medellins-mayor-accused-of-sexual-abuse/,Oscar nominee Ciro Guerra and Medellin’s mayor accused of sexual abuse
" Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe became a major asset to the Medellin Cartel after the controversial politician was appointed director of the country’s civil aviation agency in 1980.Before that, the Uribe family was already close to the Ochoa crime family, which helped late drug lord Pablo Escobar form the cartel, the former President told newspaper El Tiempo in 2002.But it was during 1978 and 1982, the year that Uribe left civil aviation agency Aerocivil, that the drug trade of Escobar and his partners really started making money, according to late Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara, who was murdered by cartel assassins in 1984.Drug trafficking in Colombia has, let’s say, a starting point, a breaking point, which is from 1978 to 1982.Late Justice Minister Rodrigo LaraThe murder that got Uribe appointedFernando UribeEscobar and one of his main former associates, Carlos Lehder, began flying cocaine from Colombia to Florida via the Bahamas after 1975.This was raising suspicion with civil aviation chief Fernando Uribe who announced in 1979 he was going to enforce the law over a growing number of illegal airstrips used by the narcos.The Aerovil chief didn’t make it until the end of the year. He was shot five times and died in Medellin in December 1979.Two theories have been gaining credibility in Bogota: it could be a mistake by the gunmen, or a retaliation by the drug trafficking mafias for the announcement that he was going to try to control the clandestine airports.El TiempoUribe’s cartel yearsUribe goes on a narco-licenses bingePresident Julio Cesar Turbay appointed the 28-year-old Alvaro Uribe as the new Aerocivil chief in January 1980.Instead of going against the cartel, the new Aerocivil chief told press he wanted to “decentralize airports”.Uribe’s “decentralization” binge resulted in him granting more licenses in 18 months than Aerocivil had done in 40 years.Almost one in 10 of the licenses ended up in the hands of associates of Escobar, Lehder and Ochoa, according to senior journalist Ignacio Gomez.From 1954 to 1981, the state had granted 2,339 licenses, and during the 18 months he was in office, he granted 2,242 licenses, with the aggravating circumstance that many of these, approximately 200, ended up in the hands of drug traffickers.Journalist Ignacio GomezColombian press found out in 1983 after a new director was appointed to Aerocivil, that among others, Uribe granted two airplane licenses to Lehder’s sister, and five to the brother and three to the cousin of Gonzalo Rodriguez a.k.a. “El Mexicano”.According to Escobar’s former hitman “Popeye” and former mistress Virginia Vallejo, Uribe also authorized the airstrip on Escobar’s legendary estate Haciendo Napoles.When he was director of Aerocivil, he authorized the airstrip at Hacienda Napoles. It was paved and perfectly visible from the sky, from a satellite. I suppose the Americans at the time had pictures of it. He authorized the strip knowing it was for Pablo Emilo Escobar.“Popeye”Uribe personally gave the order to grant Antonio Correa a license for a Hughes 500D helicopter, which would get the family in trouble in 1984, according to Aerocivil documents.The same documents showed that Israel Londoño, a brother-in-law of the Ochoas, received a license for a Bell 206 helicopter, which got Uribe accused of murder in 2006.Uribe gets caught, but gets awayIvan Duque Sr.In 1981, former Latin America’s editor Joseph Contreras, discovered that ironically, it was the father of President Ivan Duque, who was governor of Antioquia at the time, who first rang the bell in 1981 after finding out that Uribe had granted a flight route to convicted drug trafficker Jaime Cardona.According to Contreras, Duque Sr. called Uribe and told him that “in case you didn’t know, this is a businessman who is linked to the mafia.”Uribe told the governor stone cold that Cardona was “a good man.”The license was revoked after Duque Sr. personally reported the incident to the president, but neither the president’s father nor Turbay did much else and Uribe remained in his post until Turbay left office in August 1982.When Ivan Duque’s dad confronted Alvaro Uribe over Medellin Cartel licensesEscobar gets caught, but doesn’t get awayRodrigo LaraEscobar took office in the House of Representatives on July 20, 1982, one month before President Belisario Betancur (Conservative Party) took over from Turbay.Betancur appointed Uribe Mayor of Medellin, which didn’t go very well as he lasted only 112 days.Escobar was forced to stop pretending he was a legitimate politician in 1983 after Lara, who was appointed justice minister in August that year, revoked many of the licenses Uribe had granted to the cartel in September.“The airplanes converted drug trafficking into a major threat to the country,” the minister told journalists. Among the suspended helicopter licenses was that of the Bell 206 helicopter Uribe’s father bought from the cartel just before his death in June.The planes, according to strong indications, belong to Carlos Ledher, Pablo Escobar, Fabio Ochoa and Samuel Alarcon, among others, although they are registered in the name of other people at Aerocivil.Former Justice Minister Rodrigo LaraUribe gets linked to Escobar and people start dyingThe Uribe family helicopter at “Tranquilandia”Uribe really got in trouble when the National Police and the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered Tranquilandia, the Medellin Cartel’s largest cocaine factory, in March 1984.During that raid, the police found the Hughes 500 helicopter Uribe had licensed to Correa, but turned out to be property of president Uribe’s late father.Colonel Jaime Ramirez, who led the Tranquilandia operation, reportedly told investigators that Lara had warned him that “if they were going to try to kill him it would be the owners of what we seized in Yari.”“I asked him to explain and he told me: ‘Yes, the owners of the helicopter and the airplanes that were confiscated in Yari’,” Ramirez reportedly said. The colonel was murdered by cartel assassins in 1986.A 20-year-long trail of bloodPedro Juan MorenoThe justice minister and the top counternarcotics cop weren’t the last to die in relation to the helicopters found at Tranquilandia and confiscated by Lara.The Bell 206, which was licensed by Uribe personally in June 1980 and confiscated in September 1984 reappeared, albeit in pieces in 2006 with the body of Pedro Juan Moreno, Uribe’s former chief of staff, inside it.While Uribe was governor of Antioquia in the late 1990’s, Moreno was his alleged intermediary with paramilitary group AUC, specifically “Don Berna,” who inherited Medellin crime syndicate Oficina de Envigado from Escobar .I talked to Don Berna and he said that Pedro Juan had been very close with former governor Alvaro Uribe, who got into a fight with Pedro Juan and ordered him killed.Human Rights Watch investigator Maria MacFarlandBerna on multiple occasions admitted that his paramilitary group sabotaged the helicopter in which Moreno was campaigning in 2006 at the orders of Uribe.

" The Medellin Police Department and Colombia’s 4th Army Brigade played a key role in the Medellin Cartel and the formation of what is now known as the Oficina de Envigado.In the 1960’s and 1970’s, when Colombian marijuana was in fashion in the United States, the so-called “gentlemen of drugs” as narcos like Pablo Escobar, were considered respectable businessmen who received support from the local police department and the 4th Brigade.The gentlemen from Medellin provided the Caribbean mafia with pot from the surrounding Antioquia province and even as far south as Cauca.The narco history of Colombia’s security forces | Part 1: Santa MartaThe paramilitary origins of the Medellin mafiaMedellin’s current crime syndicate, the Oficina de Envigado, originates from the Security and Control Department (DSC) and the Civilian Order Department (DOC).The DSC from Envigado and the DOC from Medellin were formed in 1968, and gained force under Escobar with the support of police and mayors in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s.At the height of their power, the gangs emulated Escobar, helped the community with money and public works and were offered money. In times of peace they organized festivals and went up to the communes escorted by the police.Las décadas de NexosHow Colombia’s former president helped kick-start the Medellin CartelThe ties between the narcos, the local gangs, the Medellin Police Department and the 4th Brigade got even stronger in 1981 when they found a common enemy, the M-19 guerrilla group.After these guerrillas kidnapped Martha Ochoa, the sister of two founding members of the Medellin Cartel and a personal friend of Uribe, Escobar and his associates founded Death to Kidnappers (MAS), a paramilitary group that would later become the Medellin Cartel.Theoretically, Security and Control should disappear. But, I wonder how to do it without the security of a sufficient number of police officers? Isn’t their questionable legal status not a warning about the imperative of a municipal police, or at least be fixed and assigned to the municipality to give the mayor a chance to do his duty as head of law enforcement?Medellin Mayor Alvaro Uribe (1982)Uribe’s cartel yearsFrom gentlemen to narcoterroristsThe “gentlemen” lost their social status in Bogota after Escobar got kicked out of Congress in 1983, the cartel assassinated Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara in 1984, and the US demanded their extradition.The terrorism used in opposition to an extradition pact with the US government was mainly a problem for innocent civilians, politicians and the National Police in Bogota.In Medellin, the cartel could still find loyal allies in the local elite, the Medellin Police Department and the 4th Brigade.The cartel’s 1989 bombing of Avianca flight 203 that killed 107 people, for example, would not have been possible without former Army mayor Oscar Echandía and Medellin Cartel founder Gonzalo Rodriguez, a.k.a. “El Mexicano,” who in flew in 11 British mercenaries to give explosives lessons to cartel members and paramilitaries.The death of Major Castaño and the troubles of the other officers, almost all students in my group at the Military School, taught me many things about drug trafficking and its relationship with us, the military. One of them is that although the Colombian mafia was born and organized around families and groups like those of Escobar and the Ochoa, it does not owe its strength as an organization to this. It owes it to the military organization that knew how to copy.Colonel Bahamon DussanFrom the Medellin Cartel to La OficinaPressure from Bogota and Washington DC became too much in 1991 and Escobar agreed to go to his self-built jail, La Catedral.The cartel split after the drug lord killed associates Fernando Galeano and Gerardo Moncada, which turned the local narco elite, the local police and associates against him.According to “Popeye,” one of Escobar’s late hitmen, “blabbermouth” General Jaime Ruiz, the former commander of the 4th Brigade, helped the drug lord escape.Why few in Colombia dare to mess with retired General Jaime RuizEscobar’s cartel days were counted though as the local elite, the police and the 4th Brigade took sides with one of Galeano’s enforcers, “Don Berna,” who turned the cartel’s local enforcer army into what is now known as the Oficina de Envigado.The legendary drug lord was dead in 18 months and Berna became the new best friend of the local elite and security forces, and a founding member of paramilitary group AUC.Their extreme violence triggered the US to put the AUC on its list of terrorism organizations in 2001.How narco’s ‘great friend’ became Colombia’s counternarcotics chiefFortunately for the Medellin mafia, the AUC terrorized Colombia to vote Uribe president, allowing Berna and La Oficina to run Medellin together with then-4th Brigade commander General Mario Montoya and the local Police.Berna demobilized in 2005, but left La Oficina intact, allegedly with the help of now-suspended governor Anibal Gaviria.When Berna began talking about his ties to the local elite, the military and even accused Uribe of ordering the assassination of his former campaign manager, the 15-year-long friendship came to an end.Colombia’s 4th Brigade: an army unit or an organized crime group?Different bosses, same OficinaUribe surprisingly extradited the Oficina leader to the US in 2008 and Berna stopped talking. His lieutenant, “Rodrigo,” surrendered soon after.The Medellin elite, the local police and the 4th Brigade maintained La Oficina intact with the help of the powerful Villegas family, and the brother of Senator Jose Obdulio Gaviria, Jorge, both cousins of Escobar.To avoid extraditions, the Oficina discontinued Berna’s drug trafficking routes and turned to money laundering, extortion and allegedly arms trafficking instead.With the DEA off their back, they all lived happily ever after.

This would be the worst crash in history.Tensions between society and the security forces are also growing just when the police are being decimated by the coronavirus.Duque, notwithstanding, seemed oblivious to the alarms rung by mayors, Congress and the Inspector General’s Office over the growing crisis in his latest daily Facebook COVID show on Sunday.

" Vicky Davila is arguably one of Colombia’s worst journalists and one of the most powerful mafia infiltrators into the media.The daughter-in-law of one of the Caribbean region’s most feared mafia matriarchs got her journalism degree more than 25 years ago already, but can still not conduct an interview or spell correctly.On top of that, Davila screwed up the only scoop in her career and even porn star Nacho Vidal questioned her intelligence.Having fun with Colombia’s media | astral solutions for earthly crisesDavila invents Mafia TVFor the owners of weekly Semana, Davila was the perfect editor-in-chief of their project to create Semana TV, their experiment to create the “Colombian Fox News Network” earlier this year.Nobody knew what a Colombian version of the US television program would look like back in April, but two months later Davila had turned it into a narco plaything.The investigation into the alleged 2018 election rigging that implicated her in-laws went nowhere and the promised evidence President Ivan Duque would be involved in this fraud conspiracy never appeared.Instead, Davila made the front page of her own magazine filing criminal charges against the maker of “Matarife,” a hugely popular online series about the criminal past of former President Alvaro Uribe.The alleged crime of journalist and attorney Daniel Mendoza was to retweet an article about the decades-long criminal history of her in-laws, the Gnecco family.The notoriously criminal in-laws of one of Colombia’s most famous journalistsDeja vu of national embarrassmentsThe vast majority of Colombians would find any association to drug trafficking embarrassing, but they don’t own Semana, the magazine that introduced late drug lord Pablo Escobar to the public as the “Robin Hood” of Medellin in 1983.Most Colombians are also not called Gilinski, like the family that bought the magazine’s majority share.This family owned part of the country’s largest bank, Bancolombia, which is possibly loathed more than Davila, but the go-to bank for drug money launderer David Murcia Guzman until his arrest in 2008.Semana TV upholds a long tradition of what journalism professor Omar Rincon calls “Vicky-Journalism,” the now-matured bastard child of journalism and Davila.“In Colombia it seems common practice, but that doesn’t make it normal,” another journalism professor, María Paula Martínez, said about the phenomenon in 2016. journalismmedianarcojournalismorganized crimeVicky Davila ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-mafia-and-the-media-part-1-vicky-davila/,Colombia’s mafia and the media | Part 1: Vicky Davila
" Between 30 and 124 people had already died of COVID-19 in Colombia before health authorities confirmed the first coronavirus infection on March 6, according to the country’s statistics agency.The first suspected COVID-19 death took place on February 15, more than a month before the first confirmed death on March 21, statistics agency DANE said Thursday.According to the DANE, 30 people died of the pandemic in February while another 94 suspected deaths that months have yet to be tested by the Health Ministry.It is unclear why the DANE statistics do not coincide with those of the National Health Institute (INS).Peak could imply 500 deaths a dayEpidemiologists Guillermo Sanchez and Diego Roselli told weekly Semana they estimated that the number of daily deaths to reach 500 in August when the scholars and the INS believe the pandemic will reach its peak in Colombia.It’s an estimate. Today we’re averaging about 100 deaths a day. We’d think we’d be hovering around 500 a day. The numbers could accumulate to around 30,000 or 40,000 deaths if we keep up this pace.Epidemiologists Guillermo SanchezAccording to the epidemiologists, this peak could last approximately a week after which the daily number of deaths will begin to decrease.The INS announced that it had registered 165 deaths in between Wednesday and Thursday, the highest number to date.Daily COVID-19 deaths in ColombiaSource: National Health InstitutePublic health chief concernedINS director Martha Ospina, an epidemiologist, reiterated her concern on Thursday about Colombians’ failure to maintain social distancing as the government of President Ivan Duque continues to relax a lockdown that took force on March 25.This individual isolation is serious and goes for everyone and that’s what worries me. Are we, as Colombians,.. really putting the “if I take take of myself, I take care of others” into practice? Am I really avoiding to go out as much as I can? Do I really maintain distance from other people? I don’t party, don’t hold meetings, I don’t cut corners, I don’t consider myself very clever because I evade measures, I use masks, I wash my hands. Those things are what may save my life, and if not mine that of others, that of my neighbor, that of who I don’t know, that of my own mother. This is very important and has us very worried.National Health Institute director Martha OspinaStay at home orders have been particularly difficult to enforce in poor and hot areas, where people are either forced to go out to make a living or the tropical climate makes staying at home almost impossible to endure.This has put excessive pressure on healthcare on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, and in the Amazon region where healthcare has all but collapsed. coronavirusnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/covid-19-killed-at-least-30-in-colombia-before-first-coronavirus-detection/,COVID-19 killed at least 30 in Colombia before first coronavirus detection
" Almost three months after journalist Gonzalo Guillen revealed evidence that Colombia’s’ruling party and drug traffickers plotted to rig the 2018 elections, only the cops who discovered the alleged fraud are in jail.In an interview with Semana, the senior journalist said the jailing of the policemen was meant prevent the exposure of ties between Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party and the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa, a scandal popularly known as “Ñeñepolitica.”If they jail the two investigating  policemen — who were going to be decorated before — then the message is very clear: whoever investigates Ñeñepolitica or this kind of crime that touches guys like Duque already knows what will happen.Gonzalo GuillenChief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa, a long-time friend of the president, has embarked on a “witch hunt” and is making sure nobody at the Prosecutor General’s Office’s investigates the case, according to Guillen.The missing evidenceChief Prosecutor Francisco Barbosa (Image: President’s Office)The journalist added that Barbosa is concealing wiretap recordings of conversations between Duque’s party and the narcos before the allegedly fraudulent election in June 2018 and after the president’s inauguration in August that year.According to attorney Miguel Angel del Rio, who stumbled upon the fraud, this batch of recordings is the “most important” because it would prove not just the conspiracy between Duque’s party and the narcos, but the effective committing of the alleged election fraud.Additionally, said the attorney, these recordings would prove that the prosecution also conspired with the drug trafficking organization to frustrate the investigation into the murder of the son of his client, a tailor from the city of Barranquilla.Alleged cover-up likely successfulDel Rio successfully got a court order to release this evidence, but neither the attorney nor the journalist believe the prosecution will release the wiretap recordings of Figueroa’s late money launderer, Jose Guillermo Hernandez, a.k.a “El Ñeñe.”The audios no longer exist, they must have been destroyed, because it is an absolute priority that they may not become public; in fact, they had already been missing for a year and still no more is known than what some journalists have published and we found out on our own. They are going to have a news storm, but all those who are involved in this fraud are going to go free.Journalist Gonzalo GuillenBarbosa’s questionable behavior in the investigation is not just affecting the criminal investigation into the former personal assistant of former President Alvaro Uribe, who maintained contact with the narcos.The prosecution’s alleged destruction of evidence also affects the congressional investigation into the president’s alleged participation in the fraud and the Supreme Court investigation into Uribe, Duque’s patron. 2018 elections elections fraudelection fraudJose Guillermo HernandeznewsletterProsecutor General's Office ",https://colombiareports.com/all-investigating-colombias-2018-alleged-fraud-plot-will-end-up-in-jail-journalist/,All investigating Colombia’s 2018 election fraud plot will end up in jail: journalist
" Former President Alvaro Uribe allegedly ordered Colombia’s vice-president to appoint an ideologue of what the US government considered a terrorist organization a top government position.Jose Miguel Narvaez told the Supreme Court he joined Uribe’s 2002 government formation team despite being the ideologue of the AUC, a paramilitary organization designated a terrorist group by the US government the year before.This government formation team was led by Fabio Echeverri, a close ally of Uribe and the father of Luis Guillermo Echeverri, a close friend of President Ivan Duque.Before taking office in August 2002, Uribe ordered Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez to hire Narvaez as her personal advisor at the Defense Ministry, court documents released by news website Minuto 30 show.[Uribe] told me he didn’t want me to leave Mrs. Marta Lucia [Ramirez] alone.Jose Miguel NarvaezOnce in office, the former president ordered Narvaez’s appointment as intelligence director of the now-defunct intelligence agency DAS, he told the Supreme Court.Narvaez is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for ordering the 1999 assassination of popular comedian and journalist Jaime Garzon and the illegal spying on Uribe critics and the Supreme Court.Former Colombia intelligence chief ordered legendary comedian’s assassinationIronically, the former AUC ideologue and DAS intelligence director is serving his time at the military base that was raided in December last year for allegedly spying on Uribe critics and the Supreme Court.While Uribe was governor of Antioquia in the 1990s, Narvaez assisted the regional army units in political and psychological warfare, gave paramilitaries classes called “Why it is legal to kill a communist” and was the security consultant of ranchers’ federation Fedegan.The US government designated the AUC a foreign terrorist organization after the paramilitary groups promoted by Uribe as governor had gone on a killing spree that left 100,000 civilians dead.After Uribe became president, the DAS instructed the AUC about political targets, including peace activists, that had to be assassinated.The intelligence agency’s criminal and terrorist activity were revealed by Senator Gustavo Petro in 2009 after finding out the DAS was spying on the Supreme Court, which was trying Uribe’s cousin Mario at the time.The DAS was dismantled by former President Juan Manuel Santos in 2011 and replaced by the DNI, the intelligence agency that currently responds to Duque, Uribe’s protege.

" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque admitted his idea to organize a tax-free shopping day in the midst of a pandemic was a mistake, but stressed “we shouldn’t ask ourselves who’s to blame.”“Imbecile” went trending on Twitter on Saturday morning in reference to the president over the epidemiological nightmare that has since been called “Covid Friday.”In what Duque called part of his plan to reactivate the economy, the president revived a campaign promise to introduce three days without sales tax in the weeks leading up to the projected peak of coronavirus deaths amidst the pandemic.The tax-free shopping day turned into such a potentially deadly disaster — with huge crowds gathered at large retailers to take advantage of what was basically a 19% discount — it reached international headlines.Colombia’s economic reactivation: ‘Black Friday’ in midst of pandemicDuque admitted that “we saw a lot of disorder in the country,” after claiming he observed “a generalized standard of good behavior respecting social distancing” before becoming almost entirely incoherent.The challenge is to learn from the good, correct where necessary and advance together. If there is a mistake we should not be asking ourselves who is to blame, no, it is about how we solve it collectively, because as a society we will move forward if we leave behind the common criteria to seek to point the finger and understand that everyone, absolutely everyone, is in a process of adaptation.President Ivan DuqueBogota Mayor Claudia Lopez begged the government to limit the remaining two days of tax-free shopping to online shopping.While local authorities and health experts couldn’t hide their despair about Duque’s latest and possibly deadliest mishap, Colombians resumed their habitual ridiculing of the president and his alleged stupidity.Does anyone know if Duque has reached his highest peak of stupidity or is there still a little more to go?Twitter user coronavirusIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-president-urges-we-shouldnt-talk-about-whos-to-blame-for-his-mistakes/,Colombia’s president urges ‘we shouldn’t talk about who’s to blame’ for his mistakes
" Colombia’s congress approved a constitutional amendment to sentence convicted child rapists and killers to life in prison amid a major controversy.The constitutional amendment proposed by the government of President Ivan Duque was approved unanimously as 30 senators boycotted the vote.Whether the vote will be approved by the Constitutional Court is uncertain as the constitution explicitly prohibits life sentences and alleged irregularities in the voting process.Duque’s flagship proposal announced in July last year was opposed by the government’s own criminal policy commission, which dismissed it it as “populist,” “ineffective” and “unconstitutional.”Duque’s proposal to curb rampant child sex abuse in Colombia ‘populist’ and ineffective: expertsWho cares about criminal policy expertsDespite the objection of the experts, Duque formally proposed the constitutional amendment and Congress approved it.The president celebrated the controversial decision, claiming that “Colombia has a big reason to be happy today, now that Congress has pushed through the great reform that so many families were waiting for, which is that from today Colombia has a life sentence for rapists and murderers of minors. ”Duque lied, as the Constitutional Court first has to sign off on the bill before his proposal becomes law, which is far from certain.The court could declare the bill unconstitutional if it agrees  to the numerous claims congress approved the government proposal illegally.Furthermore, the constitution explicitly prohibits life sentences. By allowing any exception, the Constitutional Court would set a precedent that would allow Congress to legislate on all kinds of exceptions.The gravity of the situationGrowing up as a child in a country like Colombia is really difficult. It is not easy to develop in an environment where violence in all its facets is seen and lived on a daily basis, and where children are not seen as actors in building a peaceful society. We hear all the time that children are the future. But those words are not accompanied by the actions of adults.Jose (15)Colombia, which saw the murder of 165 children under 14 last year, is among the most violent countries for children in the world, according to children’s rights organization Save the Children.Pedophilia is terrifyingly common, particularly within families, which complicates accurate estimates of the magnitude of the problem.Almost 76% of all 26,062 rapes reported with the country’s Medical Examiner’s Office involved children under 14.Girls between the ages of 10 and 13 are at the greatest risk of suffering some form of sexual violence with 9,350 assessments corresponding to 41.91%. While for boys it is the age range of 5 to 9 years that is the most vulnerable with 36.47% equivalent to 1,370 cases.Medical Examiner’s OfficeMany don’t even bother reporting sexual violence with the notoriously ineffective prosecution, which was unable to even indict alleged perpetrators of sexual violence in 88% of the cases that were reported. children's rights ",https://colombiareports.com/congress-approves-controversial-bill-allowing-life-imprisonment-for-child-rapist/,Congress approves controversial bill allowing life imprisonment for child rapists
" A lawyer has corrupted journalism in Colombia to the point that the press freedom foundation in unable to reject her stigmatization of journalists while their reporting on mafia infiltration in politics already put their lives at risk.Juanita Leon, the owner of of political news website La Silla Vacia, has been accumulating so much power since 2006 that it has compromised the independence of the Foundation for the Freedom of Press (FLIP).While Leon calls the journalists who revealed evidence of ties between the mafia and the party of former President Alvaro Uribe “anti-Uribe activists,” the FLIP told Colombia Reports it “cannot deny Juanita Leon’s great contribution to FLIP.”Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersFrom the FLIP to the Leon ClanThe reality is that the FLIP has been a great contribution to the heir of multinational food producer Quala, whose website may have become the biggest recipient of foreign grants meant for the freedom of press in Colombia.Leon’s protege Carlos Cortes was designated executive president of the FLIP in 2007 and another friend, current executive president Pedro Vaca, in 2012.Not only did foreign grants allow Leon to found political news website La Silla Vacia, her allies and friend now have their own podcast, Presunta, and their own YouTube show, The Table of the Middle.Facebook gave a member of the FLIP’s assembly, where the Leon Clan has considerable influence, the authority to decide which news  on social media is real and which is fake. La Silla Vacia has its own fact-checker that falsely accused news website Colombiano Indignado of making “unverifiable claims.”La Silla Vacia decides which politician is being scrutinized and which one is not and press freedom violations are higher since the FLIP’s foundation in 2006.The Leon ClanForeign aid a gold mine for the Leon Clan, elusive for othersThe clan’s virtual monopoly over foreign grants allowed La Silla Vacia to obtain excessive control over politics on all levels through a network of regional “Sillas.”While both independent and corporate media have been struggling and sacked hundreds of journalists, Leon’s company, Blogosfera Producciones, is swimming in money, according to records from the Bogota Chamber of Commerce.The company’s net profit went up from $17,000 in 2016 to 187,000 last year while their assets went from $212,000 to $241,000, the records show.La Silla Vacia’s net profitFake independenceLeon’s access to foreign grants has allowed la Silla Vacia to expand its newsroom with “sillas” reporting on regional politics,.

" Controversial Senator Arturo Char will have a tough year presiding over Colombia’s senate while trying to prevent the Supreme Court from destroying President Ivan Duque’s coalition.The conservative Radical Change party doesn’t mind having an alleged criminal in charge of the Senate, the party of the Char dynasty member has no reputation to hold high anyway.The chances of Char being sent to jail after his July 7 Supreme Court hearing are so small that party president German Cordoba confirmed on Wednesday his party is willing to take the risk.The Senate Radical Change bench has discussed the issue of who will be our nominee to assume the presidency of Congress in the next term twice and has elected Senator Arturo Char.Radical Change party president German CordobaThe big risk is that the incoming senate chief may go down before finishing his term and could take the president and his coalition with him.The ‘clans’: the criminal forces rigging Colombia’s economy and democracyTense year ahead for Duque’s coalitionTwo weeks after Char’s first court hearing over his alleged support for the 2018 election fraud and the 2019 jail break of fugitive politician Aida Merlano (Conservative Party), the dynasty politician will be given the Senate gavel.Aida Merlano (Screenshot: YouTube)Whether the heir of the notoriously corrupt clan from Barranquilla will make it until the end of his term is a gamble, but one both Char and Radical Change are willing to make.Colombia’s Supreme Court isn’t easy — it’s already sent the senator’s cousin to prison for 27 years without a blink — but the high court isn’t very fast either and could allow Char to finish his one-year term.The court ordered to investigate Char in September last year already, but didn’t call him to trial until last week.While evidence of Char’s involvement in Merlano’s fraud and prison break has yet to emerge, the fugitive politician’s explosive testimonies so far have implicated all major coalition parties and even President Ivan Duque.How crooks elect presidents, according to Colombia’s first and only voter fraud convictThe court case: spectacle guaranteedChar’s trial is going to be a guaranteed spectacle; the senator was already accused of Merlano’s election fraud, but was additionally accused of helping the junior clan member break out of jail last year.Merlano accused President Ivan Duque of being implicated in both her election rigging and jail break. In fact, she has accused the president of being involved in a plot to have her murdered.Senator Arturo Char while campaigning for President Ivan Duque (Image: Twitter)The fugitive politician has yet to provide evidence of any of her claims, but Merlano so far seemed hell-bound not to be the only politician in the history of Colombia to be sentenced for vote-buying.Merlano may have no evidence to link Duque to vote-buying in the Atlantico province, but her claims confirm evidence the president was involved in election fraud in the neighboring provinces of Magdalena, Cesar and La Guajira.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersThe cesspool of Caribbean politicsThe president is being investigated by Congress over both alleged election fraud cases that in Atlantico involve the Char clan and coalition party Radical Change.In the other Caribbean provinces, evidence implicates that Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, and his far-right Democratic Center party conspired with the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa to rig the presidential elections.To complicate matters, evidence indicated that the Char clan and Figuroa’s late money launderer, Jose Guillermo Hernandez, were in business together in 2010.Char will be put to the test, being a suspect in one of Colombia’s most high-profile court cases involving three coalition parties while presiding over the senate.If the dynasty politician screws up, the Supreme Court may not just end Char’s career, but jeopardize the president and his congressional coalition as well. 2018 electionsArturo CharAtlanticoChar clanelection fraud ",https://colombiareports.com/alleged-election-fraudster-to-preside-colombias-senate-while-in-court/,Alleged election fraudster to preside over Colombia’s senate while in court
" Top officials of Colombia’s security forces are suspected of arms trafficking for organized crime groups, weekly Semana reported on Thursday.A network within the 4th Brigade in Medellin, the Arms Trade Control Department (DCCA) and apparently the Colombian Military Industry (Indumil) allegedly trafficked arms and illegally granted firearm licenses, the weekly reported.The military’s counterintelligence officials got wind of the irregularities in 2016 and since 2019 received assistance from Medellin’s prosecution office that arrested former 4th Brigade commander General Jorge Romero in August last year.Medellin soldiers and military contractors suspected of giving out gun licenses to crime lordsAhead of the general’s arrest, Semana reported that the 4th Brigade was granting arms licenses to Medellin crime syndicate Oficina de Envigado.A recently leaked counterintelligence report on “Operation Baton” reportedly confirmed that the Medellin-based army brigade continues to be a cesspool of corruption with ties to organized crime.What the Operation Baton report did not mention were the National Army’s 7th Counterintelligence Battalion’s 2018 findings that the illegal licensing of firearms was not limited to Medellin, but involved Major Alexander Cardona, the director of the DDCA office in Bogota.According to this report, Cardona granted licenses to members of Los Pamplona, a drug dealing gang that is active in the east of Antioquia, after they were refused licenses by the DDCA offices in Medellin, the province’s capital.While investigating the matter, counterintelligence began wiretapping suspects and learned that members of this “criminal network were already negotiating illegal arms sales with an alleged military official with arms produced or sold at Indumil.There’s plenty for sale. We have Jerichos, there’s Berettas, there’s a bunch, whatever you want.Alleged military official on wiretapAt least one of the sales of arms allegedly acquired illegally at Indumil and sold to organized crime groups were negotiated in Fase Dos, a strip club in Medellin, according to the wiretap.While the criminal investigation by Medellin’s prosecution office focuses on the arms sales of which it has evidence following the incident with Los Pamplona, the evidence indicates that the 4th Brigade’s illegal license sales to organized crime groups had become the norm by then.While this alleged arms trafficking racket is news, the ties between La Oficina and the 4th Brigade are not. In fact, they go  back to at the heydays of Pablo Escobar if not before.Colombia’s 4th Brigade: an army unit or an organized crime group?The scandal revealed by Semana is the latest of a series that followed the appointment of former National Army commander Nicasio Martinez by President Ivan Duque in December 2018.The arms trafficking, however, indicates that the military’s ties to organized crime go back further, not just in Medellin, but also at the military headquarters in Bogota. arms traffickingBogotaMedellinmilitaryorganized crime ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-military-investigated-over-arms-trafficking-for-illegal-armed-groups/,Colombia’s military investigated over arms trafficking for illegal armed groups
" The popular belief that late drug lord Pablo Escobar ordered and financed the 1985 guerrilla attack on Colombia’s Palace of Justice increasingly appears to be a far-right urban myth.The latest to discredit the claim were four former M-19 commanders who confessed to Colombia’s Truth Commission about the Palace of Justice Siege that killed approximately 100 people, including half the Supreme Court.“Military lies”According to former M-19 commander, Jose Otty Patiño, “I have direct knowledge that this was not ordered by or consulted over with drug traffickers.”Former guerrilla commanders Alvaro Jimenez, Vera Grabe and Dario Villamizar confirmed this and said the military had been spinning the claim to discredit the group.According to the guerrillas, the “lie” about their ties to the Medellin Cartel became popular belief after constant repetition by members of the military and the country’s far-right.What is very damaging to the truth is wanting to link the M-19 with drug trafficking, that is taking away the political meaning of that takeover. We know it was a mistake, but it was a political act.Former M-19 guerrilla Vera GrabeColombia’s military never intended to save hostages in Palace of Justice siegeEscobar and the M-19M-19 co-founder Juan Marcos Ospina became friends with Escobar in 1984 when the guerrillas and the narcos made peace after a three year-war sparked by the M-19’s kidnapping of Martha Ochoa, a member of a Medellin crime family who would later form the Medellin Cartel.The guerrillas who talked to the Truth Commission said Ospina was so close with Escobar. the guerrilla leader was the only M-19 member allowed to talk to the drug lord.Many guerrillas were unaware of Ospina’s friendship with Escobar and would have disapproved. Other lower-ranked guerrillas would do favors for the cartel, but never at the highest level.Ospina was kicked out of the group in December 1984 after he openly expressed his sympathy for the cartel’s intention to kill American citizens and remained friends with the Medellin Cartel boss until the former guerrilla leader was killed in a military operation in August 1985.The moneyIn his 2002 book “My Confession,” paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño made the first claim that M-19 leader Carlos Pizarro received $2 million dollars from Escobar in May 1985 to carry out the attack later that same year.The book came out 11 years after Castaño ordered the assassination of the M-19’s presidential candidate after their demobilization in 1990. Castaño was assassinated in 2004.While in prison, Escobar’s late lieutenant “Popeye” told a commission between 2003 and 2006 that Escobar gave $2 million dollars to Ospina in late 1985, but this money disappeared after the former guerrilla leader was killed.The drug lord’s then-girlfriend, former TV presenter Virginia Vallejo, told the same commission that Escobar met with M-19 ahead of the attack on the Palace of Justice, but mentioned no money.The coincidencesDays before the M-19 attack, the drug lord and one of his partners, Carlos Lehder, became increasingly threatening with the Supreme Court in their attempt to dissuade them to approve the extradition of drug lords to the United States.The last death threat to magistrate Manuel Gaona was sent days before the attack by “the Extraditables”.Time is inexorable and you know very well that the deadline we set for you is about to expire and everything seems to indicate that you are not interested in your personal safety and the integrity of your family.

" Colombia’s government informed the Constitutional Court that it expects the coronavirus to kill more than 41,500 citizens before the end of the year, local media reported Tuesday.Between March 6 and Tuesday June 16, the National Health Institute (INS) had registered 1,801 confirmed deaths of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.The real number of deaths is believed to be much higher and, according to the Health Ministry, is projected to reach 41,500 by the end of December.The number is considerably lower than the 220,000 and 310,000 victims the INS in March projected would have died by mid-June had the government of President Ivan Duque not imposed a lockdown.Colombia calculates Duque inaction would have caused at least 212,000 coronavirus deaths by mid-JuneThe health effects of the lockdownThe lockdown, regional measures to restrict the mobility and recommendations like social distancing have lowered the projected number of deaths and pushed the expected peak of active cases forward.According to the Health Ministry, the INS now believes the pandemic will reach its peak on August 18 while the country’s hospital system is expected to be tested to the fullest next week.However, “if every Colombian doesn’t take measures seriously, there will be more infections and more deaths,” INS director Martha Lucia Ospina warned on Tuesday in President Ivan Duque’s daily Facebook transmission.By Thursday next week, the INS projected a total of 14,577 intensive care units will be necessary. According to the Health Ministry, the country on Monday had 6,685 of which half were occupied.Until the end of August, a total of 30,000 hospital beds would be needed for Covid-19 patients.The national emergencyThe peak of the pandemic is expected less than two weeks before the end of the national emergency that has allowed the government to decree far-reaching measures to combat the coronavirus and its economic effects.This emergency ends on August 31 unless the government decides an extension is necessary.Local and regional governments will be able to continue issuing decrees to combat the pandemic depending on the situation in their city or province after September 1. coronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-projects-41000-coronavirus-deaths-before-end-of-2020/,"Colombia projects 41,000 coronavirus deaths before end of 2020"
" Scholars monitoring Colombia’s peace process urged the government of President Ivan Duque to accelerate the country’s peace process that has slowed down under his watch.The Kroc Institute of the US University of Notre Dame has quantified the level of progress of the implementation of a 2016 peace deal with now-demobilized FARC rebels.In their latest report, the researchers concluded that the implementation has slowed down over the past year as “with many short-term stipulations already completed, implementation shifted in 2019 towards the medium- and long-term  commitments, especially those focused on the territories most affected by the armed conflict.”According to the Kroc Institute, “this new phase requires greater interinstitutional coordination and intense deployment at the local level. Therefore, more time is needed to finalize their implementation.”Levels of implementation of Colombia’s peace accordsSource: Kroc InstituteThe researchers called on the government to accelerate the implementation of social and economic reforms to prevent that  the ongoing coronavirus pandemic worsens conditions that previously led to violence in war-torn areas.Particularly promised land reform that sought to narrow the economic inequality “made little progress in the last year,” while this traditionally has fueled violence in the countryside.Another point where the Kroc Institute registered little progress was the implementation of the counternarcotics policy due to resistance by both the government and drug traffickers.The killings of participants and both male and female leaders of the Program continued, generating great fear in their communities. Point 4 also proposes general reforms to the anti-drug policy with the participation of civil society, which was limited in the last year.

" Bogota’s mayor said Sunday that local authorities will take control over both public and private hospitals to prevent the coronavirus from collapsing the healthcare system of Colombia’s capital.Following a meeting with Health Minister Fernando Ruiz, Mayor Claudia Lopez declared an orange alert and said that the city’s Urgencies and Emergencies Regulation Center (CRUE) would be coordinating the most critical phase of the pandemic.As part of this, the capital’s private hospitals will temporarily become part of the public health system to make sure all Bogota residents have access to healthcare.As we started to relax, people started to get worse. Last week we exceeded 50% ICU occupancy already. It is not dramatic, but the level of occupation increases and the ventilators that allow us to expand the capacity have not yet arrived. We are going to try to match the increase in occupancy with the arrival of ventilators, but we cannot be confident.Bogota Mayor Claudia LopezThe merging of the public and private hospital system is meant to secure “that every citizen has an equal opportunity for the right to health to be taken to any of the ICUs available in the city, whether public or private,” said Ruiz.While the idea to merge the systems was announced by the Bogota mayor weeks ago already, Ruiz claimed the measure was a national government idea as Lopez and President Ivan Duque have been in a power struggle over the response to the pandemic.The health minister and Lopez have increased cooperation after the two clashed last week about the government’s failure to comply with promises that would allow the healthcare systems in Bogota and other cities to deal with the pandemic.Lopez has long been one of Duque’s biggest critics. The coronavirus and the government’s response to the pandemic have exacerbated the tensions between the president and Colombia’s second most powerful official.Colombia’s two presidents combating coronavirusBogota, a city of 7 million, has by far Colombia’s most solid public healthcare system, which is now strengthened by adding the private hospitals.This temporary measure could inspire other mayors, especially those where the healthcare system is considerably more prone to collapse, to do the same.Duque has so far not shown any interest to allow the temporarily nationalization of the private hospitals. claudia lopezcoronavirusFernando ruizhealthcare ",https://colombiareports.com/bogota-takes-control-over-private-hospitals-as-coronavirus-pandemic-enters-critical-phase/,Bogota takes control over private hospitals as coronavirus pandemic enters critical phase
" Colombia’s health authorities have confirmed more than 50,000 total coronavirus infections and 1,500 Covid-19 deaths in total and 75 deaths on Sunday alone, the deadliest day of the pandemic so far.According to the National Health Institute, the total number of infections reached 50,939. More than 21,000 of these people have since been confirmed healthy.Despite an increase in testing on patients who previously tested positive, the INS has been unable to stop the gradually growing number of infections, which forced the capital Bogota to declare an orange alert.Healthcare in the southwest of the country has collapsed and also on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, where the healthcare systems are barely holding on.The increased pressure of coronavirus is also raising tensions between the country’s healthcare workers and President Ivan Duque who, against all advise, has been trying to reactivate the economy before containing the coronavirus’ spread.Local and regional authorities’ orders that restrict movement have prevented an uncontrollable spread.The mayors and governors’ stay at home orders are increasingly difficult to enforce, especially in areas where poverty and the tropical heat impedes people from staying at home.In Colombia’s Andean region, where both living and weather conditions are more favorable, this has been less of an issue.More than three months after the coronavirus was first confirmed in Colombia, still “the health system is not prepared to confront the emergency,” the director of the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC), Sergio Isaza, told newspaper El Tiempo.The FMC chief blamed the country’s inability to respond to the crisis on “corruption and the malfunctioning of the system.”Throughout the country, medical personnel continue to work under precarious circumstances, mainly due to the failure to deliver enough and adequate personal protection equipment necessary to responsibly treat infected or possibly infected patients.The months June and July will see the highest number of coronavirus infections and COVID-19 deaths, according to projections. coronavirushealthcare ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-exceeds-50000-coronavirus-cases-1500-deaths/,"Colombia exceeds 50,000 coronavirus cases, 1500 deaths"
" Three years after Colombia’s prosecution decided to blame innocent civilians for a terrorist attack on a Bogota shopping mall, the victims’ families are still waiting for a real investigation.The Prosecutor General’s Office meanwhile is desperately trying to avoid embarrassment and an investigation while the bomber and his possible conspirators walk free.The bombing and the messageThe June 17 bomb attack on the Andino mall in the exclusive Chapinero neighborhood left two Colombians and one French citizen dead, and nine other people injured.The terrorist attack also delivered a clear political message to the Colombian people that President Juan Manuel Santos’  promise of peace made four days earlier was empty.Peace is a reality. The signing of the Final Agreement for the construction of a stable and lasting peace with the FARC-EP is a definitive step towards ending 50 years of violence that has left more than 8 million victims and 220,000 dead. Finally, a path of hope is opened for the next generations of Colombians to live in a country in peace.Former President Juan Manuel Santos (June 13, 2017)Stage 1: Ignoring and disappearing evidenceFormer chief prosecutor and alleged fraudster Nestor Humberto MartinezAlmost immediately after the attack, National Police director Jorge Nieto said it was too early for any hypothesis on who was behind the attack.According to Nieto, the Judicial Police of the Prosecutor General’s Office had assumed the investigation and had begun looking at the video footage.Former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez never cared about justice for the victims, he needed a scapegoat to demonstrate he was not an inept fraud, and quick.The morning after the bombing, weekly Semana said that among the suspects were guerrilla group ELN, paramilitary group AGC and “dark forces”. Semana focused, however, on the MRP, a group nobody outside Bogota had ever heard of.El Tiempo cited “government and intelligence sources” claiming the activist group was behind the bombing.Police warnings from June that the AGC was planning bomb attacks in Bogota and Medellin were ignored.Leaked internal memo (Image credit: Caracol Radio)The explosives allegedly used in the bombing changed within days and the video footage of the bombing mentioned by Nieto mysteriously disappeared.Sketch of the alleged bomber seen leaving the ladies room. (Image: Prosecutor General’s Office)Instead, the prosecution released sketches of six men deemed suspicious by witnesses three days after the attack, adding the witness’ descriptions were contradictory.The sketch of the man allegedly leaving the ladies’ room was also never used in court as he resembled none of the victims of the prosecution’s alleged hoax investigation.Stage 2: Faking resultsA Bogota judge on June 30 agreed to jail five men and four women, all of them social activists and attorneys. None of them were charged with their involvement in the bombing, but of being members of the MRP.The leftist activist group, which fiercely condemned the attack, denied knowing any of the arrested activists. The detainees denied having anything to do with either the MRP or the bombing.A 10th suspect, Ivan Ramirez, was arrested in early July. Ramirez is a sociologist, but the prosecution prefers media calling him “Taliban.”Because the prosecution had no evidence to indicate any of the suspects had anything to do with either the terrorist attack or the leftist activist group and refused to investigate the bombing, an embarrassing cat and mouse game began.Every time judges ordered to release the political prisoners, the prosecution arrested them again only to be told to release them again.Political prisoners releasedLina Jimenez and Ivan RamirezThe Prosecutor General’s last arrests were made earlier this month when officials again arrested Cesar Andres Barrera and Cristian Sandoval after a judge in Cali agreed to warrant their arrest without evidence.By Friday, however, the men and six of the other political prisoners were free again.Artist Lina Ramirez and Ivan Ramirez are the only ones left in prison, but likely to be released again before the end of this week.Three years after a bomber took the lives of Julie Huynh, Ana Maria Gutierrez and Lady Paola Jaimes, their families are still waiting for justice while Colombia’s prosecution can expect lawsuits for their three-year-long rape of justice.

" Colombia’s security forces forcibly eradicated 30% less coca in the first four months of the year compared to last years efforts, not exactly the 40% increase promised to the US government.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told newspaper El Espectador earlier this month that “Illicit crop eradication operations are being carried out in accordance with the timetable established for 2020, which aims to eradicate 130,000 hectares of coca in the country.”The minister’s imaginary statisticsTrujillo must be receiving statistics other than those of his own Defense Ministry that show the security forces have eradicated 17,000 hectares between January and April.The minister also said that the forces eradication would continue as planned during the state of emergency that took force in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, again contradicting his own ministry’s statistics.Forced eradication in 2019 and 2020Source: Defense MinistryIn fact, everything indicates that the latest counternarcotics strategy of US President Donald Trump and his Colombian counterpart Ivan Duque which was announced by Trujillo after a visit by US Defense Secretary Mark Esper in February is an enormous failure.The Colombian government boasted how it had been able to increase coca eradication in 2019 only to be let down in March by the White House, which said coca cultivation had reached an all-time high of 212,000 hectares.Credible coca cultivation and cocaine production estimates are expected in later this year when the United Nations Office and Drugs and crime (UNODC) presents its annual report.The UNODC has consistently claimed Trump and Duque’s strategy was doomed,Crop substitution program all but deadThe voluntary eradication program, which is widely considered more effective, appears to have come to a standstill. According to the UNODC, less than 150 hectares were voluntarily eradicated.Notwithstanding, post-conflict adviser Emilio Jose Archila said the  program brought to life by Duque’s predecessor Juan Manuel Santos as part of the peace process “was very successful.”In a sense it is, because according to the UN agency, it has been able to verify that farmers replanted coca in only 0.2% of the 41,000 hectares that have been eradicated since May 2017.The Defense Minister said in February that the replanting after forced eradication was 40%, less than half than the 81% registered by the UNODC in 2018.Notwithstanding, the government has expressed no interest in continuing the program once the 100,000 families currently taking part have received their substitute crops.Any progress on spraying?Duque said in June lat year that he believed the court would lift the ban on the aerial spraying with coca the next month.The court told him the president could forget about that in July.His US counterpart told Duque in March “you’re going to have to spray,” which Duque tried.The government tried to take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic and seek the compulsory local consensus through online voting in areas where there’s barely any internet, but farmers blocked this in court in May.Meanwhile, the situation in the countryside is getting grimmer by the week as farmers refuse to starve to death voluntarily. Instead, at least a dozen have died in clashes with police.The US military announced earlier this month it had sent in extra forces, fifty-three to be exact, according to the defense minister. The opposition asked the court to expel the foreign soldiers who would allegedly be sent to traditional conflict areas and order the resumption of the peace process. coca cultivationDrug policyIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-counternarcotics-policy-falling-apart/,Colombia’s counternarcotics policy falling apart

" Colombia’s Congress hadn’t even begun investigating evidence of President Ivan Duque’s ties to drug traffickers when local media revealed the brother of his vice-president is a convicted narco.News website La Nueva Prensa revealed on Tuesday that Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez and her husband paid USD$150,000 to bail out her brother in 1997 after Miami cops caught him receiving heroin from drug mules.Ramirez’ brother Bernardo was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison in February 1998, half a year before the politician was appointed Foreign Trade Minister and her political patron, former President Andres Pastrana, began negotiating counternarcotics strategy “Plan Colombia” with the administration of US President Bill Clinton.The revelation came weeks after transnational crime website InSight Crime revealed the VP and her husband, Alvaro Rincon, were in business with “Memo Fantasma,” who trafficked cocaine for the Medellin Cartel and the AUC paramilitary group.Colombia’s vice-president tied to senior narco: reportWhile opposition Senator Gustavo Petro and other Colombians demanded the resignation of Ramirez on Twitter, Duque claimed the disgraced VP was a “dignified and courageous woman” and the victim of a “tragedy.”The president rejected the “smear” and highlighted the top positions Ramirez had been granted by Duque’s political patron and another former Medellin Cartel associate, former President Alvaro Uribe.The VP also called her brother’s drug trafficking activities a “tragedy” and said she would “continue to serve the country.”Colombia jails policemen who discovered 2018 election fraud conspiracyTwitter users were quick to point out that Ramirez’ 2018 campaign slogan that “there are no good and bad drug traffickers, they are all are bad and must be rejected,” apparently doesn’t hold when they are family, a member of the ruling party or business partners.The VP’s latest association with drug trafficking came only hours after her husband spoke out publicly for the first time about his ties to Memo Fantasma, and a day after the policemen who stumbled on Duque’s ties to the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa were jailed. drug traffickingMarta Lucia Ramireznarcopolitics ",https://colombiareports.com/even-brother-of-colombias-vp-turns-out-to-be-convicted-narco/,Colombia’s VP admits after 23 years brother is a convicted heroin trafficker
" The seemingly endless absurdities of magistrate Cristina Lombana are increasingly becoming an embarrassment for Colombia’s Supreme Court.Lombana has been a problem ever since President Ivan Duque appointed the former army major in 2018, but seems to have reached the point where she may be best described as the high court’s own village idiot.On Tuesday alone, newspaper El Tiempo reported that she was scolded by colleagues for meeting with military commanders while formally investigating them, and two senators accused her of going on witch hunts that seemed to be bordering on insanity.Lombana’s alleged investigation bingesSenator Armando Benedetti (U Party) said he would ask Congress to remove the magistrate after she had ordered to investigate at least 300 of his acquaintances for no apparent reason.“Nobody wants to talk to me, not because they think I’m guilty or smell bad, but because as soon as they talk to me, that lady calls them in for an investigation,” according to the lawmaker.Ironically, Benedetti is not exactly known for being Colombia’s least corrupt politician. The magistrate’s alleged rigor and failure to find any dirt on the lawmaker doesn’t make Lombana look very intelligent.The U Party congressman surprisingly received support from opposition Senator Gustavo Bolivar, who accused the magistrate of screaming at the employees of his former television production company in an apparent attempt to investigate him on something.“That magistrate does not have the qualifications for that position,” according to Bolivar.More trouble in courtBolivar’s claim was confirmed by court sources that according to newspaper El Tiempo claimed that Lombana had met with top military officials while investigating the army over illegal spying practices.Her colleagues removed her from the case around the time the court opened an investigation against former President Alvaro Uribe, a client of Jaime Granados, one of Lombana’s former employers that she had forgotten to inform the court about.According to El Tiempo, magistrates Cesar Reyes and Marco Antonio Rueda refused to recuse her for allegedly being among the targets of the illegal spying, but because of misconduct.Not only did she meet with military commanders while investigating them, she also linked the investigation to an unrelated investigation against Uribe from 2014, the magistrates reportedly found out.Lombana’s endless list of absurditiesLombana’s latest scandals add to a whole list of irregularities that would get anyone prosecuted had they not been a Supreme Court magistrate.After the court shielded the magistrate from investigations against Uribe because she failed to tell her colleagues she used to be Uribe’s subordinate as well as a colleague of the former president’s attorney, Lombana began harassing the magistrate who assumed the investigation, which currently has the former president in court on fraud and bribery charges.The magistrate also never told the court that she married a convicted murderer, Lieutenant Colonel William Roberto del Valle while he had gone on a second murder spree.

" Drug cartels from Mexico purposely frustrated Colombia’s peace process to prevent the disruption of cocaine exports, according to a recent study.The study by think tank Peace and Reconciliation (Pares) confirmed prosecution reports indicating that Mexican cartels were preparing the FARC’s 2016 abandonment of criminal activity before 2014 already.According to Pares, the Mexicans took preemptive action to prevent the FARC’s demobilization which would harm their interests as the demobilization of paramilitary organization AUC did between 2003 and 2006.The strategy was so successful that the Mexican cartels were able to increase their influence in Colombia like never before, according to the investigators, and increase potential cocaine exports to record heights.No trafficking without cocaineMexico’s drug cartels have seen so many Colombian drug cartels and guerrilla groups come and go that changing trafficking partners is part of the routine.The demobilization of the FARC was different because it didn’t threaten only distribution, but also supply.Most of Colombia’s cocaine was produced in territory controlled by the FARC whose guerrillas also protected part of the routes from the cocaine factories to the export hubs.The peace process additionally contained a counternarcotics strategy that allowed coca farmers to switch from coca to legal crops.To prevent the collapse of production and chaos in distribution, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Gulf Cartel and the Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel began arming groups that could take over control of coca-rich FARC territories and drug trafficking routes.Emissaries were sent in to optimize the yield of cocaine factories, prevent turf wars and set up new money laundering schemes, according to Pares.The prosecution got wind of the cartels’ increased activity in 2017 when Colombian Immigration reported an atypical increase in visitors from Mexico and Central America after 2014.The Mexican revolutionTo what extent the boom in cocaine production during Colombia’s peace process is due to primarily the Sinaloa Cartel’s strategy is impossible to say.In southeast Colombia, where the FARC had been working with the cartel for years, the dissident groups led by “Ivan Mordizco” and “Gentil Duarte” were able to quickly expand their territorial control after 2016.In the southwest of Colombia, the same cartel allegedly financed the rearmament of other FARC dissident groups, but without successfully consolidating territorial control.The Sinaloa Cartel’s most powerful associate before the peace process, paramilitary group AGC, was severely weakened after its unit in the Bajo Cauca region split off, allegedly with the support of the Gulf Cartel, while the paramilitaries were under attack from ELN guerrillas in the western Choco province.The presence of both the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel has increased tensions in Norte de Santander where the Mexicans support different groups.What is certain is that the Mexican cartels successfully frustrated the counternarcotics element of the peace process with the FARC while making their Colombian associates more reliant on Mexican arms provisions and know-how in money laundering. drug traffickingFARC dissidentsMexicoSinaloa cartel ",https://colombiareports.com/how-mexicos-drug-cartels-helped-colombias-narcos-frustrate-peace-process/,How Mexico’s drug cartels helped Colombia’s narcos frustrate peace process
" Colombia’s finance minister promised Congress on Tuesday he would look into the possibility of implementing a universal basic emergency income in response to the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus.In a virtual session, Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla gave in to the congressional majority that has been asking for a  basic emergency income (BEI) while the country is struggling to reactivate the economy that was all but shut down in March.Colombia considering guaranteed minimum income as famine loomsThe proposal is supported by the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which has urged countries to consider audacious measures to prevent extreme poverty.Carrasquilla has slowly been moving towards the Congress’s position after initially dismissing the proposal that would cost  approximately $10.4 billion (COP40.5 trillion), which is 4% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to Congress’ calculations.The minister told the House of Representatives he was not considering the BEI as an emergency measure during the ongoing national emergency, but said a universal basic income (UBI) could be “a next step.”I believe it is a step forward in terms of a major social policy effort that has been made in this country… I believe that, in this context, in which there have been gigantic advances, which have managed to reduce poverty from 50% to 25%, a next step can be a measure like a basic income.Finance Minister Alberto CarrasquillaDespite Carrasquilla’s step forward, Green Alliance Senator Ivan Marulanda told Spanish newspaper El Pais that a universal basic income is not the emergency measure more than 54 congressmen and influential politicians from both the liberal and the conservative side of the spectrum have been asking for.What we are saying is that it has to be now because many companies have gone bankrupt, unemployment is increasing and people are enduring a lot of hunger.Senator Ivan MarulandaCongress and influential liberal and conservative politicians have become increasingly critical of Carrasquilla and President Ivan Duque over their response to the crisis that cost 5.4 million Colombians their job in April alone.Basic income.

" A growing number of magistrates of Colombia’s Supreme Court is considering to remove Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa from a 2018 election rigging plot investigation to avoid further embarrassment.According to newspaper El Espectador, several magistrates have lost confidence in Barbosa, who is supposed to investigate ties between the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa and one his best friends, President Ivan Duque.They reportedly want a special prosecutor to investigate the plot between Figueroa’s money launderer and Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party in rigging the elections in the north of the country.The newspaper reported that the magistrates want to avoid a similar embarrassment as with Barbosa’s predecessor, Nestor Humberto Martinez, whose conflict of interest turned the Odebrecht bribery scandal investigation into all but a charade.Why Colombia could never see Odebrecht’s bribery clarifiedBarbosa has barely finished his first 100 days in office, and has already succeeded in destroying his credibility and that of the prosecution over all too evident attempts to protect, instead of prosecute, Duque’s political allies.Almost immediately after taking office, the chief prosecutor decided in February to investigate the daughter of fugitive congresswoman Aida Merlano instead of her alleged conspirator over her October 2019 jail breaks.When a month later journalists revealed evidence that Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, had been coordinating the rigging of Barbosa’s friend’s election, the chief prosecutor really started losing control.Wiretapping of drug trafficker reveals vote-buying for Duque on Uribe’s ordersWhile Congress began investigating the president and the Supreme Court his political patron, Barbosa was hesitant and was later accused of withholding crucial evidence.Friday’s decision to  arrest the policeman who discovered the election fraud plot was apparently the straw that broke the camel’s back for a number of court magistrates.Colombia arrests cops who discovered 2018 election fraud plotMartinez’ removal from parts of the Odebrecht case was the first time the court took such action, setting a precedent that would allow them to push Barbosa aside and let an independent prosecutor investigate the case that is slowly destroying Duque’s legitimacy and confirms his party’s ties to narcos. 2018 electionselection fraudFrancisco BarbosaJose Guillermo HernandezProsecutor General's Office ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-supreme-court-may-remove-chief-prosecutor-from-election-rigging-probe/,Colombia’s Supreme Court may remove chief prosecutor from election rigging probe
" The coronavirus pandemic is causing a triple food crisis in Colombia, with hundreds of thousands facing famine, farmers unable to sell their produce and food distributors struggling with social distancing.Meanwhile, coronavirus outbreaks in the country’s ports could disrupt food imports, while the minister responsible for food security during the crisis, Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Zea, is expected to appear before the Supreme Court for corruption.The situation isn’t unique to Colombia, according to the World Food Program (WPF), which estimates some 14 million throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, mostly in Venezuela, will suffer food shortages this year.Lockdown triggered immediate hungerIn Colombia, the hunger began for the poor as well as for the farmers, almost on day one of the March 25 lockdown that sought to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus.Despite national and local government efforts to provide food, “6% of the respondents didn’t eat anything the day before the survey and reported skipping meals regularly. 13% had only one meal,” the WFP said after  a poll.Meals eaten day before surveySource: World Food ProgramWhile people starve, farmers’ food rotWhile people were starving, food distribution networks broke down and farmers also started running into trouble, as they were left with food they couldn’t sell. Meanwhile, 5.4 million Colombians were left without a job.There are products that are in crisis because the costs of collection are higher than what the intermediary pays and, in many cases, no buyer is found, so the food ends up being thrown away, especially fruit. This is a pity, while there are other regions suffering from hunger.National Farmers Association chief Luis Alejandro Jimenez,According to Zea, the agriculture ministry has begun a program, involving mainly young farmers, that will allow them to offer their products online, as food distribution centers are only allowed to work at 50% of their capacity, because of the social distancing measures.A failure to respect social distancing measures, previously triggered the closure of food distribution centers Corabastos in Bogota and La Minorista in Medellin.Wednesday was Cali’s turn when an outbreak in the Santa Elema neighborhood forced Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina to shut down the wholesale food market for nine days.Trouble only beginningThe lockdown was only a warm-up as the coronavirus is going to make it difficult for farmers and for distributors to effectively deliver food to the food shops.The World Food Program said in April that the global economic crisis is going to make things even worse as at least 900,000 Venezuelan migrants are expected to be put on the brink of starvation.On top of those, 5.4 million Colombians will be uncertain where their food comes from as Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla refused to decree Congress idea for a temporary basic minimal income.More than half of Venezuela’s refugees in Colombia at risk of starvation: UNHow to change an entire food supply networkZea’s plan to create online platforms that would allow consumers to buy directly from farmers should not just be a good deal for both food consumers and farmers, it would help the food distribution centers to meet their social distancing targets.We are innovating and adapting to the requirements of these times, to guarantee that we reach the peasants in the remote regions of Colombia with the financial resources.Agriculture Minister Rodolfo ZeaZea’s innovation sounds a lot like a pilot project in Medellin that sought to mitigate the effects of the lockdown by creating a platform that allowed farmers to deliver food packages directly at their customers’ doors.Medellin farmers go online after coronavirus lockdown abruptly ends street marketsFood distributors in biggest fixWhile customers and farmers potentially could benefit from the removal of intermediaries, the food distributors appear to be in trouble.Food distributors staged a massive protest at Corabastos on Thursday after they were told by Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez they could only work at 35% of their capacity.(Image credit: Corabastos)The city hall agreed to raise this to 50% in the food distribution center that provides fruit and vegetables for much of central Colombia.Meanwhile, the reduced activity at Corabastos may not lead to food shortages and price hikes, according to the Bogota government. coronavirusFood Security ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-attempts-to-solve-triple-coronavirus-food-crisis/,Colombia’s attempts to solve triple coronavirus food crisis
" Colombia’s prosecution arrested the policemen who accidentally discovered a 2018 election rigging plot between the far-right party of President Ivan Duque and drug traffickers.The arrest of Major Yefferson Tocarruncho and Sergeant Wadith Velasquez went almost unnoticed because chief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa caused a political hurricane by ordering the arrest of Antioquia Governor Anibal Gaviria on vague corruption charges.The Gaviria family: prolific land thieves now after Colombia’s 2nd largest economyNot the suspects, but the investigators in jailFormer President Alvaro Uribe (L) and late mafia associate Luis Guillermo Hernandez.

They decided to make the local leaders the scapegoat for the government’s failures and the abuses of the prosecutor’s office.Bogota Mayor Claudia LopezAllegedly corrupt prosecutor charging cops, protecting questionable colleagueProsecutor Daniel Hernandez (Image: W Radio)According to prosecutor Daniel Hernandez, the officials of the National Police’s intelligence unit DIJIN were illegally wiretapping five cops exactly when they found that the money launderer of drug trafficker Marquitos Figueroa was plotting with Duque’s Democratic Center party to rig the elections.Ironically, the prosecutor was accused of trying to frustrate a corporate spying investigation in January and, according to Blu Radio, is being investigated by the Superior Judicial Council on charges of illegal wiretapping.According to the controversial prosecutor, the colleague who signed off on the policemen’s wiretap requests, Jenny Andrea Ortiz, was deceived by the police investigators.Ortiz is the prosecutor who reportedly decided not to investigate the evidence Figueroa’s drug trafficking organization had ties to Colombia’s ruling party.The laziness or corruption — or both — of the prosecution is deplorable. I wonder why the 21st Prosecutor of Organized Crime (Jenny Andrea Ortiz Ladino) is on the side of organized crime. There has to be an answer.Journalist Gonzalo GuillenFive years after Figueroa was arrested in Brazil, the drug lord has yet to be convicted and on several occasions was almost released because Ortiz allowed legal time limits to expire.Politics before justice?The arrest of the police officials is the latest controversy in the investigations that has all but destroyed the reputation of Barbosa, one of the president’s best friends.The chief prosecutor was accused of withholding evidence Congress needed to investigate Duque and the Supreme Court needed to investigate former President Alvaro Uribe.Barbosa’s office is supposed to be investigating other suspects in the case, like Uribe’s former personal assistant Maria Claudia Daza, but the prosecution is apparently more interested in prosecuting  the police investigators who discovered the biggest election fraud scandal in recent memory. 2018 electionselection fraudJose Guillermo Hernandezmarquitos figueroa ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-arrests-cops-who-discovered-2018-election-fraud-plot/,Colombia arrests cops who discovered 2018 election fraud plot

" Colombia’s Health Minister Fernando Ruiz has succeeded in turning almost all medical organizations against him as his coronavirus response — as foretold — is turning into a disaster.In his latest attempt to evade responsibility, Ruiz blamed hospitals for receiving an “economic incentive… to extend the time of care in intensive care units more than necessary”.The accusations baffled hospital organizations and triggered the Superintendent of Health to almost immediately clarify he received no information that would sustain the minister’s claim.The Colombian Association of Critical Medicine and Intensive Care, the Colombian association of Scientific Societies, the Colombian Medical College and the Physicians union immediately rejected the baseless accusation.AMCI believes that the ministry’s statements are unfortunate because, in addition to the pain and uncertainty that the disease brings, it creates a cloak of doubt about the moral, ethical and human integrity of the intensive care workers and a climate of distrust that can negatively impact the timeliness of care and cause an adverse emotional effect and anxiety in the health team.Colombian Association of Critical Medicine and Intensive CareOther healthcare organizations had already withdrawn their support for the minister over his failures to live up to promises to bolster the healthcare system and protect healthcare workers.Colombia’s medical community withdraws confidence in health ministerThe administration of President Ivan Duque for months has ignored warnings that prematurely lifting lockdown measures could collapse Colombia’s healthcare system and further damage the economy.Duque and Ruiz initially tried to pretend the healthcare system wasn’t collapsing, but this is also failing and “the worst is yet to come,” according to the National Association of Healthcare Professionals.The worst of the crisis is yet to come and with the opening of the lockdown it will get worse.National Association of Healthcare ProfessionalsFacing growing accusations of mismanagement, the health minister apparently believed scapegoating the medical organizations would help him evade responsibility for the growing crisis.And if that wasn’t enough, Ruiz on Saturday decided to pick a fight on Twitter with epidemiologist Zulma Cucunuba of the Imperial College.Meanwhile, Colombia’s healthcare systems is collapsing, healthcare workers say they are still without personal protection equipment that would allow them to responsibly attend the pandemic and the country is in an administrative chaos. coronavirusFernando ruizhealthcarehealthcare crisis ",https://colombiareports.com/health-minister-blaming-hospitals-for-colombias-coronavirus-chaos/,Colombia’s health minister blaming hospitals for coronavirus chaos
" The online series “Matarife” said it would “morally do away with” Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe, but it has become so popular it threatens his entire inner circle.Following episode three, President Ivan Duque on Monday stressed on Twitter on Monday that Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez “is an honorable professional with a long history of service to Colombia.”Apart from linking Colombia’s ambassador Alejandro Ordoñez to neo-nazis, the non-fiction series claimed Ramirez secretly met with commanders of paramilitary group AUC after Uribe named her Defense Minister in August 2002.The president giving free advertisement to a YouTube series is historic, and arguably as stupid as Ramirez suing the series.Colombia’s VP to sue series on Uribe, but doesn’t seem to know for whatThe one Colombian you don’t want to sueDaniel MendozaIf there is one person in Colombia you don’t want to sue, it is Daniel Mendoza, who may have written Matarife, but is an attorney.Lawyers don’t present evidence on YouTube, they do so in court. Ask Uribe or any of his attorneys.After the former president sued Mendoza’s client, senior journalist Gonzalo Guillen, the court ruled the two had enough evidence to sustain that Uribe is a narco, a paramilitary, a mafioso, a murderer and “Matarife,” which means “slaughterer” or “buffoon.”Ironically, Ramirez’ attorney was the one representing Uribe in that case. According to Mendoza, the mistake of the VP’s lawyer inspired him to produce Matarife.‘Top Colombia radio host bribed to favor Medellin Cartel founder’YouTube can’t order criminal investigationsMarta Lucia RamirezIt will not be on Youtube where the public will find out whether the attorney-turned-producer has evidence the VP drank champagne with terrorists, but in court.YouTube can’t order criminal investigations, but the court can, and this is  where Mendoza can get Ramirez in a lot of trouble if not in prison.The State Council convicted the state in 2018 because the former Defense Minister’s habit of putting civilians’ lives at risk got 36 innocent civilians killed in a 2003 FARC terrorist attack.Ramirez has been able to evade justice only because Colombia’s prosecution has ignored the court order to investigate her culpability in the bombing at the Club Nogal in Bogota.Why Colombia’s government opposes FARC terrorism victimsHonorable, really?According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “honorable” means “deserving of respect or high regard,” which does not apply to Colombia’s VP, unlike the proverb “pride comes before the fall.”The second Ramirez tries to defend her honor before a judge, Mendoza will have evidence indicating Colombia’s VP is scum, after which a judge can order a criminal investigation.Matarife has only just aired it’s third episode and is already being sued by Uribe and Ramirez.With more than 40 episodes to come, Mendoza may morally do away, not just with Uribe, but with the entire inner circle of the former Medellin Cartel associate.

" Colombia’s healthcare system may not even survive two months, which would severely slow down economic recovery, yet President Ivan Duque’s COVID-19 coordinator believes he is “on the right track.”“The indicators allow us to know we’re heading in the right direction,” Carlos Alvarez, the president’s COVID-19 coordinator, said on Friday.Alvarez was not referring to combating the virus, but to reopening businesses.According to Colombian Medical Federation vice-president Carolina Corcho, however, the impending collapse of Colombia’s regional healthcare systems would mean that “soon we’ll have to return to a stricter lockdown.”While under-reporting, registered infections have risen sharply. All this while the President’s decision to lift the quarantine is put in practice.

Without any, hospitals will run out of intensive care units before the end of the state of emergency on August 31.The government’s decision to further open up the economy on Monday could only collapse hospitals even faster.The combination of a raging pandemic and a collapsed healthcare system would cause such instability, Duque and his COVID-19 coordinator can forget any plans to reopen the economy.Active coronavirus cases in ColombiaSource: National Health InstituteSuspending other healthcareThe relatively large number of free beds boasted by the government is not because it has been able to substantially expand hospital’s capacity, but because, for example, almost 60% of cancer patients say they are simply being refused treatment.The number of active coronavirus infections has been doubling every two weeks, implying that — despite already denying people healthcare, and even without reopening the economy — with the current acceleration rate the hospitals will have saturated in eight weeks.At that point, there won’t be healthcare for neither serious COVID-19 cases nor anyone else needing emergency care or an ICU.Alvarez said that the measures to prevent this are “easy.” All they require is “optimal social discipline,” “self-care” and “local regulation,” apparently clueless of the evidence and the warnings that this is not working.

" The coronavirus pandemic triggered Colombia’s unemployment rate to skyrocket to 19.8% in April, a rate not measured since one of the country’s worst crises in history in 2000.April’s rate is 9.5 percentage points higher than the unemployment measured in the same month last year and 7.2 points higher than in March when the government of President Ivan Duque all but shut down the economy.Colombia’s unemployment rateSource: DANECities hit hardestThe pandemic that forced the shutdown cost some 5.3 million Colombians their jobs as a consequence of the pandemic that was first confirmed in the country on March 6, according to statistics agency DANE.The pain was felt hardest in the country’s 13 largest cities that saw unemployment more than double from 11.% in April last year to 23.5% last month.Almost two thirds of the unemployed population is located in 13 major cities and metropolitan areas. The urban areas are the most affected by social measures to reduce the mobility of people and thus ensure the life and health of citizens.DANE director Juan Daniel OviedoThe excessive job losses in the cities are largely due to the forced closure of Manufacturing and, commerce and construction.The countryside was relatively spared as agricultural food production continued.Reactivation or guaranteed minimum incomeAssuming businesses haven’t gone bankrupt or can’t viably restart, President Ivan Duque has rushed to reopen the economy in defiance of Congress, which fears outbreaks of the coronavirus could collapse the healthcare system, force a second shutdown and slow down economic recovery.The Senate urged Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla to urgently implement a guaranteed minimum income that would prevent starvation and a collapse of the healthcare system through a more gradual reactivation of economic activity as proposed by the medical community.While under-reporting, registered infections have risen sharply.

" Medical organizations said Monday that Colombia’s President Ivan Duque has failed to live up to promises to help health workers combat the coronavirus.In an open letter, The Colombian Federation of Medical Unions, the Colombian Association of Scientific Societies and the Colombian Medical College said they never received little more than promises.It is incomprehensible to us that in the midst of a situation as delicate and pressing as the COVID-19 pandemic we have received nothing but ovations, applause, words of praise and promises that have so far failed to materialize or represent a crucial improvement in our precarious working conditions.Health workersThe health organizations accused the administration of making more effort to evade responsibility than to effectively protect the lives of the health workers on the frontline of the pandemic.“To date we continue having difficulties related to the provision, the sufficiency in availability and existence, and the quality of equipment,” according to the organizations.The health workers added that promised improvements of their often precarious labor situation have been diluted by exceptions and conditions that are basically a bonus.If a health worker is infected by the coronavirus and unable to work, this is only considered a work-related illness if related to patients with evident symptoms, “a condition we find absurd when 80% of the COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic,” the organizations said.Additionally, health workers  are not paid if they have to go into quarantine after having been in touch with an infected patient and have no life insurance in case they die of COVID-19.The organizations additionally rejected the fact that hospitals and healthcare intermediaries have suspended or ended contracts with health workers in the weeks leading up to the expected peak in June and July.The health workers are the latest accusing Duque and his administration of making promises that are never or only partially fulfilled. coronavirushealthcareIvan Duque ",https://colombiareports.com/health-workers-latest-to-accuse-colombias-government-of-false-promises/,Colombia’s health workers latest to accuse Duque of failing promises
" Colombia’s government has made several moves during the coronavirus crisis that could severely threaten the country’s peace process and prospects of peace in general.It would only be natural if the pandemic consumed attention of the administration of President Ivan Duque at the cost of the peace process that began in 2016, but this hasn’t been exactly the case.With the support of the government of US President Donald Trump, the government has actively pursued policies that severely increase the chances of armed conflict reigniting, according to peace activists.Defendamos la Paz speaks out against plans for the reforms of the Peace Agreement, which the government and the ruling party failed to obtain through legislation, to become a reality through the back door, while the citizenry remains focused on the pandemic.Peace organization Defendamos La PazDenying victims rightsVictims protests in front of the war crimes tribunal. (Image: Twitter)During the emergency, Duque’s peace commissioner, Miguel Ceballos, implemented a policy that sought the individual demobilization of members of illegal armed groups instead of collective demobilization processes.The policy is virtually a repetition of the former policy of Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, which benefits war propaganda while completely depriving victims of their rights to justice, truth and reparation.The individual demobilization of guerrillas, paramilitaries and narcos allows the government to present each demobilization as a result in the war while ignoring the illegal armed groups’ recruitment of new fighters.While extracting intelligence from these individuals and using them for war propaganda purposes, the government shields the demobilized members of illegal armed groups from compensating their victims or contributing to clarifying their crimes.So far, the clarification of crimes committed during the armed conflict has largely exposed how the state has inflated guerrillas’ responsibility for the violence while minimizing its own.Why Colombia’s government opposes FARC terrorism victimsPeace talks with the ELN(Image: El Pais)Neither Colombia’s last-standing guerrilla group, the ELN, nor the government appear to have any serious interest in talks that could lead to a peace process with the guerrillas.The government did make a superficial effort to reestablish informal contact with the ELN by appointing two so-called “peace promotors,” but this was quickly rejected by the rebels.The ELN appears to be putting its money on using the coronavirus crisis to forge a bilateral ceasefire that would alleviate the situation for inhabitants of regions controlled by the guerrillas until Duque steps down in 2022. The administration, however, has shown no interest in this.At the request of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the ELN declared a unilateral ceasefire in April, but highlighted how the military ignored this request and continued to carry out attacks.The ELN then said it would adopt a “defensive strategy” in an apparent attempt to make Duque look like the main aggressor.With Colombia’s economy tanking, the guerrillas can only win as soaring unemployment will make recruitment only easier.Why peace talks with Colombia’s ELN rebels are so difficultPeace process with FARCDuque appointed three ministers to take part in the National Commission for Security Guarantees (CNGS) during the state of emergency, but failed to convoke this commission.The CNGS is supposed to formulate policies that would allow the dismantling of structures formed by paramilitary death squads, the private sector and public officials that have existed for decades and are by far the main violator of human rights in Colombia.This commission was supposed to be meeting monthly since 2017 already, but has only met a few times in arguably the grossest violation of the peace deal.The biggest obstacle appears to be that Duque and his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, are being investigated for conspiring with narcos to rig the 2018 elections.In fact, there are indications that Duque’s far-right Democratic Party would be nothing but a fringe party had it not been for paramilitary groups and narcos.Meanwhile, hundreds of human rights defenders and community leaders, as well as demobilized FARC guerrillas, have been assassinated during the peace process.Is Duque’s conflict of interest promoting political violence in Colombia?Killing social leaders / political persecutionSocial leaders in La Brisas reunite in La Florida, Choco, two years after one of their fellow leaders was assassinated. (Image: Melissa Jaimes / UN Photo)The lockdown to slow down the spread of the coronavirus has confined human rights defenders to their homes, while guerrillas, narcos and paramilitaries have continued the extermination of activists.According to conflict monitor Indepaz, at least 70 social leaders and 20 FARC members taking part in the peace process have been assassinated so far this year, in what appears to be an extermination campaign.The killing of social leaders is terrorizing entire communities while the persistent killing of demobilized FARC members spurred the former guerrillas’ former political chief, to rearm.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa additionally has been accused of abusing his power by ordering criminal investigations against Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez and opposition Senator Gustavo Petro, some of Duque’s main critics that could result in at least five years in prison.Other social leaders critical of the government and journalists have been arrested on apparently trumped up charges while journalists have been detained for no reason.Last but not least, journalists, NGOs, politicians and the Supreme Court have reportedly been spied upon by the National army.Made invisible by pandemic, mass killing of Colombia’s social leaders continuesSo-called counternarcoticsWhile in the middle of the pandemic, The US Embassy and the US Army’s Southern Command announced the deployment of so-called Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB), which will carry out joint missions in what Duque dubbed “Future Zones,” war-torn regions historically abandoned by the state and controlled by the FARC until their demobilization in 2017.The sending in of US soldiers is part of a gradual destruction of a counternarcotics strategy supported by the United Nations.Duque’s five “Future Zones” had already excluded 12 other war torn areas which had been included in the peace deal to receive development aid.The sending in of US soldiers to support forced eradication efforts is diametrically opposed to the government’s obligation to seek peaceful initiatives to include these regions in the legal economy through the investment in sustainable agriculture.The mission is even more controversial because the soldiers will be assisting Colombian task forces accused of having ties to traffickers.The announcement last month was rejected by farmers organizations, counternarcotics experts and social organizations who demand the implementation of the peace deal, not an escalation of violence.US troops to help combat drug trafficking in Colombia’s war-torn areasEvading international scrutinyWhile in the epicenter of the pandemic, the extension of Colombia’s contract with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the contract to monitor progress of the strategy to reduce cocaine production by helping coca farmers enter the legal economy through road infrastructure, the granting of land titles and the substitution of coca crops, has silently been ignored.Even before taking office in August 2018, Duque’s former Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas said he would stop this so-called PNIS program.The government is legally obliged to continue this program, but has defunded it, with disastrous consequences for farmers who voluntarily removed coca, only to be left starving to death.Without independent verification Duque will be able to claim to be executing the program without any independent organization being able to verify the claims of the government that has become notorious for its disinformation.Colombia ends coca crop substitution monitoring deal with UN: reportMore deaths is more good newsDefense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo (Image: Defense Ministry)The government has stepped up bombarding media with combat results instead of reporting on the progress in the implementation of peace policies.Following the rules of war propaganda, the Defense Minister has reported all kinds of arrests and killings of alleged members of illegal armed groups that are almost impossible to verify because of the lockdown.Coincidentally, the Defense Ministry reports have also helped to make ongoing complaints about the government’s alleged failures to attend the coronavirus pandemic more invisible, not to mention the incessant complaints about military corruption. armed conflictcoronavirus ",https://colombiareports.com/how-colombia-is-using-coronavirus-pandemic-to-end-peace-process/,How Duque is using coronavirus pandemic to end Colombia’s peace process
" Escalating tensions with Cuba spurred Colombia’s opposition to call the country’s peace commissioner to Congress on Monday.Opposition senators Ivan Cepeda (Democratic Pole) and Antonio Sanguino (Green Alliance) reiterated Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos should resign after Cuba’s Foreign Ministry’s rejection of the government of President Ivan Duque.In a letter to Bogota, Havana claimed Duque’s administration “facilitated” the US government adding the island state to its list of countries that refuse to cooperate to combat terror.The administration of US President Donald Trump cited Cuba’s refusal to extradite peace negotiators of leftist rebel group ELN as requested by Duque in violation of international agreements.Colombia’s president suspended peace talks with the guerrillas when taking office in August 2018 and demanded their extradition after an ELN terrorist attack in January last year.Duque has refused to acknowledge international agreements made by his predecessor Juan Manuel Santos ahead of the peace talks that, among other things, obligate Bogota to guarantee the safe return of ELN negotiators in the event peace talks fail.Instead, the Cuban Foreign Ministry accused the Colombian government of hostility through “public statements, threats and summonses, by an ungrateful and politically motivated manipulation of our unobjectionable contribution to peace in Colombia.”For the opposition, the increased tensions with Cuba confirm Duque’s peace commissioner is a threat to peace in the country.“Ceballos has taken it upon himself to destroy any peace process. He has damaged Colombia’s credibility. How is it possible for a country to betray the countries that have helped it negotiate peace in its territory?” Cepeda told newspaper El Espectador.The peace commissioner celebrated the US government’s decision to add Cuba to the uncooperative countries list, claiming it showed “great support” for the government’s refusal to acknowledge international agreements.With the exception of that of the US, no government has expressed support for the Duque administration’s request to extradite the peace negotiators.

" One of Colombia’s best-kept secrets is that former President Alvaro Uribe turned Bogota club El Nogal into “a second presidential palace,” courtesy of  his old Medellin Cartel buddies.Few knew of the club until the now-demobilized FARC guerrilla group carried out a terrorist attack in 2003 that killed 36 people and left almost 140 people injured.The government of President Ivan Duque and the club’s former owners want to keep it at that, not only because the Council of State ruled his political patron used civilians as a human shield and ordered the government to compensate the victims.If the public finds out that Uribe’s former Medellin Cartel associates were facilitating secret meetings between the former president’s administration, the business elite and allegedly paramilitary chiefs, this would further be another nail in the coffin of the far-right Democratic Center party.The terrorist attackThe FARC, the primary culprits of the massacre, has always said they were trying to kill the AUC’s military chief, Salvatore Mancuso, believing he was in the building. He wasn’t.Instead, the guerrillas massacred innocent civilians who had nothing to do with the AUC or Uribe’s shady businesses.The top government officials who had been using the building for months to conduct government business left just before the attack. They had been tipped off by a guerrilla informant, according to the court.Judicial authorities additionally found out the club’s shareholders were convicted drug trafficker “El Papero,” the Ochoa crime family that founded the Medellin Cartel, and the Cifuentes crime family that links Uribe to the Sinaloa Cartel, RCN Television owner Carlos Ardila Lulle and imprisoned former Bogota Mayor Samuel Moreno.‘Sinaloa Cartel paid Uribe to facilitate drug trafficking route between Colombia and Mexico’The second presidential palace, but without securityFernando LondoñoAccording to the Council of State, Uribe and his former Interior Minister Fernando Londoño turned the social club into a “second presidential palace” where both the business elite and mafias had free access to ministers until the day before FARC drove 240 kilos of explosives into the building without anyone noticing.Londoño was one of the club’s owners and allowed Uribe to use the club as a campaign center ahead of the 2002 elections. To return the favor, Uribe appointed the far-right ideologue Interior Minister.After taking office in August 2002, almost every minister and top security official — many of whom are now in prison — used the social club for government affairs.It is also certified that the activities carried out in the club’s facilities by the minister previously appointed between August 2002 and February 2003 were carried out in the presence of Congressmen Miguel de la Espriella, Andres Gonzalez and Gina Parody, Alfredo Cuello, Claudia Blum, Armando Benedetti, German Vargas, Jesus Piñacue, Juan Fernando Cristo, Jesus Ignacio Garcia, Jorge Caballero, Luis Humberto Gomez, Myriam Paredes, Nancy Patricia Gutierrez, Rafael Pardo, Roberto Gerlein, Telesforo Pedraza and Antonio Navarro Wolf; Inspector General Edgardo Maya, Defense Minister Martha Lucía Ramirez, Prosecutor General Luis Camilo Osorio, National Narcotics Director Alfonso Plazas Vega, Director of the Administrative Department of Security Jorge Aurelio Noguera, Coldeportes Director Daniel Garcia Arzabaleta, Ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes, National Police director Teodoro Campo, Air Force commander General Miguel Alfonso, Plan Colombia director Sandra Suarez, Social Protection Minister Juan Luis Londoño, Agriculture Minister Carlos Gustavo Cano, Education Minister Cecilia Mara. It should be noted that these were meetings to address issues of national importance attended by high-level government officials, ministry officials and public figures.Council of StateEl Nogal’s administrator at the time told the Council of State that authorities appeared to ignore all warnings about the attack and took no precautions despite it having become “a second presidential palace.”Londoño, who was later removed from office for corruption, left the building hours before day of the attack.FARC warnings ignored, paramilitary meeting reportedThose who lost loved ones in the attack want to know why the government did nothing despite being warned by the FARC informant involved in the planning of the attack half a year and two weeks before the attack.Even the guerrillas themselves formally said they considered the club a military target, claiming that the government was “opening the doors of the new institutionality to the paramilitary hitmen by facilitating them entrance to the clubs of the North of Bogota for their meetings with political and business leaders without any authority bothering them.”Local media reported that not just the Uribe administration, the military and the business elite were doing business there, but also Mancuso, who the guerrillas wanted to kill.Mancuso was engaged in pulling the strings of high politics. In an exclusive club, north of Bogota, the military chief of the self-defense groups met with friendly congressmen. In broad daylight, as if it were just a working lunch and not an appointment with one of the men most wanted by justice, Mancuso began by explaining to them why Castaño – and himself – had decided not to surrender to US justice. He then asked the legislators for their support in finding a legal formula for pardoning their crimes that did not require them to have a political status.SemanaMancuso has so far denied being president in El Nogal, but one of his fellow commanders, “El Aleman,” told victims the truth will come out as he is working with them, the war crimes tribunal and the FARC to clarify what happened.FARC carried out the bombing, but what was Uribe doing?Nobody disputes that the FARC carried out the terrorist attack, but the State Council does not understand why Uribe would bring almost his entire government from the presidential palace to a civilian facility that was partly owned by old Medellin Cartel associates and controversial business tycoons.What also raised questions is that the club administrators were never warned about the FARC’s terrorist plans while on the day of the bombing all government officials had disappeared.In defiance of the court, the government has refused to pay damages to the victims and has refused to cooperate with the victims, the war crimes tribunal and the demobilized armed groups to find out what happened.This is leaving a lot of questions though, as one of Club Nogal’s owners, Dolly Cifuentes, had two children with Uribe’s older brother and her brother would travel to Mexico four years after the attack to become the right hand man of “El Chapo.”Their shares in the club weren’t seized by authorities until after Uribe left office in 2010. El Papero lost his’ in 2013.Meanwhile, Uribe’s  followers have accused the victims of the FARC attack of being guerrillas.

" The United States embassy said Wednesday that American soldiers will assist Colombia’s security forces in counter-narcotics operations in war-torn areas prioritized in the peace process.The so-called Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) will carry out joint missions in what President Ivan Duque calls “Future Zones,” regions historically abandoned by the state and controlled by the FARC until their demobilization in 2017.Four of these five areas are also major coca growing regions where dissident FARC factions and other illegal armed groups maintain control over the drug trade with increased help of Mexican drug cartel emissaries.The SFAB mission in Colombia is an opportunity to show our mutual commitment against drug trafficking and support for regional peace, respect for sovereignty and the lasting promise to defend shared ideals and values.US Southern Command chief Admiral Craig FallerThe SFAB mission of “several months” will begin in June as part of a the “Enhanced Counter Narcotics Operations” carried out throughout the hemisphere “to reduce the flow of illicit drugs, degrade transnational criminal organizations, and increase interoperability with our partner nations and interagency partners,” the US Southern Command said in April.US President Donald Trump announced these operations early last month as part of what Defense Secretary Mark Esper called a “whole-of-government approach to combating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and protecting the American people from their scourge.”The production and export of cocaine in Colombia “kills our farmers, destroys forests, wildlife and contaminates the rivers and seas,” the US embassy quoted Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo as saying.The SFAB’s of more than 500 soldiers did not exist until 2018 and also meant to bolster US allies dubbed “weak states” by American military scholars.Colombia, whose state has historically been considered weak, has been struggling to lower cocaine production, partially because its National Army has been bogged down by corruption. drug traffickingnewsletterUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/us-special-forces-to-help-combat-drug-trafficking-in-colombias-war-torn-areas/,US troops to help combat drug trafficking in Colombia’s war-torn areas
" While local authorities alerted Colombia’s healthcare system has begun collapsing, the Health Ministry said it has been strengthened.Despite spending months on social media, reality threatens to slowly catch up on President Ivan Duque.The number of deaths of COVID-19 continues to accelerate, local and regional authorities threaten to burst the president’s bubble so the Health Ministry jumped in his defense.Cartagena: healthcare for the rich, police for the poorFollowing the collapse of the remote Amazonas province in the southeast, the coronavirus has now begun collapsing healthcare systems in some of the country’s most important cities“There are no intensive care units [ICU’s] left” in Cartagena, Senator Fernando Araujo, a local dynasty politician, told newspaper El Tiempo.Local newspaper El Universal and political news website La Silla Vacia reported 15% of Cartagena’s ICU’s are still available, just not for the poor.Coronavirus sinks Cartagena from being Colombia’s pride to Colombia’s shameAccording to El Universal, the city’s elite requested the quarantine of the city’s poor neighborhoods where the virus has spiraled out of control, and with success, confirmed by La Silla Vacia.The neighborhoods “where poverty and factors such as overcrowding and gang rule make total confinement even more difficult” were simply quarantined, leaving its residents at the mercy of the virus. What is disturbing is that this is happening in several of the large popular neighborhoods that register more cases, “the other Cartagena” as some call it to differentiate it from the tourist city of postcards.La Silla VaciaThe Colombian Medical Federation for months has warned private healthcare intermediaries were doing this, but were simply ignored by Duque and his Health Minister Fernando Ruiz.Exactly like in Amazonas, the government sent in the security forces instead of healthcare equipment.Meanwhile, Cartagena “has pretty much collapsed,” according to La Silla Vacia.One week after promising health supplies to southeast Colombia, government vows aid to bury the deadWest Colombia’s healthcare tragedyThe mayors of the country’s third largest city Cali, Jorge Ivan Ospina, the interim mayor of the country’s Pacific port city Buenaventura, Victor Hugo Vidal, indicated they will not be able to reactivate the economy as  Duque wants, unless the government delivers the healthcare reinforcement they were promised since March.The government’s failure to bolster healthcare as promised has brought their cities’ hospitals to the brink of collapse, the mayors said Wednesday.Many of our strategies and proposals for the reactivation of various sectors will have to wait. It is impossible to put lives at risk and we must think not only of patient care in Cali but also in Buenaventura and the metropolitan area.Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan OspinaBuenaventura is Colombia’s largest port city and crucial for much of the country’s food imports, but the hospital  in the city of 400,000 resident only has 25 ICU’s and never received promised aid to confront the pandemic.In a letter, the city’s interim mayor asked Duque not to allow any further economic reactivation while the historically neglected city is unable to deal with the pandemic.If the country keeps up this pace of opening up, opening up and opening up, and Buenaventura is included there, it will make it very difficult to control the situation, so we ask the National Government not to include Buenaventura in the activationBuenaventura Mayor Victor Hugo Vidal“Buenaventura is not prepared,” regional Health Secretary Maria Cristina Lesmes confirmed.According to local hospital director Julio Gomez, this is in part because the government was as busy reactivating the economy as it was slow to reinforce healthcare.We have been waiting for the 56 beds that the Ministry of Health promised us in mid-April.Hospital director Julio GomezAlso in the neighboring Choco province, which doesn’t even have an ICU, “the situation is more critical than you can imagine,” Interim Governor Jefferson Mena told newspaper El Tiempo.Mena replaced suspended governor Ariel Palacios, who allegedly used the crisis to go on an embezzlement binge, leaving the main hospital without resources.What they’ve done with the hospital has no name, it’s put the people of Choco in danger of death, it’s a disaster.Choco interim Governor Jefferson MenaThe situation in Tumaco, a port city on the Ecuadorean border, is also spiraling out of control, according to locals.According to the National Health Institute, the number of infections in the city has shot up to 530 while the city’s hospital received only six ventilators.Opposition Senator Gustavo Bolivar said on Twitter that “it’s waiting for another massacre, this time by COVID-10.”Also in Tumaco, the government has completely ignored the situation, social leader Denis Obregon told public radio station Radio Nacional.For two and a half months we have been waiting for humanitarian aid in Tumaco. They have forgotten us, we are practically starving.Tumaco social leader social leader Denis ObregonThe Health Ministry disagreed, claiming Wednesday that “today, Colombia has a healthcare system that has been strengthened and trained to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.” coronavirushealthcarehealthcare crisisnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-denies-reports-healthcare-system-is-collapsing/,Colombia denies reports healthcare system is collapsing
" Colombia’s chief prosecutor became the joke of the day on Monday when he said he would investigate the former opposition candidate over a plot to rig the 2018 elections in favor of President Ivan Duque.Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa wasn’t trying to be funny at all, but Duque is the chief prosecutor’s friend and the mafia teaming up with Duque’s far-right Democratic Center party in the election rigging plot speaks for itself.Colombia’s narcos have killed more important people for less, so Barbosa told radio station RCN that “within the report of the investigating prosecutor there is talk of alleged financing of miners in Gustavo Petro’s campaign.”The opposition senator’s response on Twitter was short, but clear. “Hahahahahahaha,” Petro tweeted.What conspiracy Barbosa was talking about is unclear as media have the same wiretaps as the prosecution, despite its attempt to conceal the evidence.Reporters so far have found audio of former President Alvaro Uribe’s former assistant plotting with the late money launderer of drug trafficker Marquitos Figueroa to swing the elections in favor of Duque.The evidence triggered the Supreme Court to investigate Uribe and Congress to investigate Duque. The only thing Barbosa had to do was file criminal charges against Uribe’s former assistant, Maria Claudia Daza.This, however, would be like opening Pandora’s Box; Daza was Uribe’s PA for years. She was a witness in the Supreme Court investigation against the former president over his alleged manipulation of witnesses linking him to death squads.Were Barbosa to do his job, he could destroy his own party, obtain evidence that could throw his friend in jail and risk retaliation from both drug traffickers and the far right.The chief prosecutor is only 5 foot 6, skinny, balding and spent most his career teaching law at some elite university in Bogota. Barbosa wouldn’t stand a chance against either the narcos or the far-right, let alone both.The chief prosecutor would probably not stand a chance if he took Petro to court either, but getting laughed is a lot less bad than getting killed.

" Colombia’s chief prosecutor is under increased pressure to recuse himself from the investigation into a plot to rig the 2018 election in favor of his friend, President Ivan Duque.The country’s congressional opposition called on Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa to remove himself from the investigation on Tuesday after announcing an investigation into Duque’s opponent in the election, Senator Gustavo Petro.Barbosa’s announcement triggered ridicule until it reached Congress where opposition Senator Gustavo Bolivar said “there are no guarantees” for a serious investigation “if he stays.”Colombia’s chief prosecutor: getting laughed at is better than getting killedLaw experts show little faith in chief prosecutorAcademics also called on Barbosa to remove himself from the investigation with the dean of the law department of the prestigious Los Andes university saying on Twitter that “the prosecution needs to urgently recover its credibility, not end up losing it.”Even before Barbosa’s latest move, human rights organization Dejusticia had already called on the chief prosecutor to remove himself from the investigation, claiming that his “close friendship with the president” constituted an evident conflict of interest.Duque and Barbosa have been friends since they went to law school together more than 25 years ago.Colombia’s ruling party allegedly involved multiple crime families in 2018 election fraud plotBarbosa’s ‘evidence’ against opposition leaderPetro revealed the audio that, according to the chief prosecutor, merits a criminal investigation into the opposition politician’s campaign manager.In the audio, late mafia figure Jose Guillermo Hernandez told an unidentified person that Petro won the first round of elections in the northern La Guajira province “because of those fucking miners. All those assholes went for Petro.”The late money launderer of drug trafficker Marquitos Figueroa added that “they won’t be able to do much. The adjustment coming next is with force.”Only the Supreme Court can step inWhile Barbosa plans to investigate his friend’s opponent in the election, Congress is investigating the president and the Supreme Court is investigating President Alvaro Uribe, who allegedly led the election fraud plot.The court has the power to remove Barbosa from the case and appoint a special prosecutor if it agrees with the opposition and human rights defenders that the chief prosecutor’s conflict of interest is in the way of a serious investigation.Former Prosecutor General Nestor Humberto Martinez was removed from much of the investigation into the bribery practices of Brazilian engineering firm Odebrecht and banking conglomerate Grupo Aval.Until then, the court had never blocked investigations from the Prosecutor General, but set a legal precedent with Martinez’s removal from the case. 2018 electionselection fraudFrancisco BarbosaJose Guillermo Hernandeznewsletterpolitical persecutionProsecutor General's Office ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-chief-prosecutor-under-fire-over-investigation-into-election-rigging-plot/,Colombia’s chief prosecutor under fire over investigation into election rigging plot
" Medellin’s mayor claimed on Monday that his response to the coronavirus is “an example to the world,” an old PR hoax that previously led to investigations by Colombia’s war crimes tribunal.No foreign news outlet, government or institution has called Medellin an example, making Mayor Daniel Quintero’s claim sound a lot like the “transition” mantra of his predecessors who were boasting dropping homicide statistics  while 900  people were “disappeared.”In fact, it’s this sinister propaganda practice that spurred Colombia’s war crimes tribunal to investigate Medellin and Quintero’s predecessors.Medellin could be Latin America’s largest mass grave, war crimes tribunal finds outNew mayor, same trickExactly like his predecessors, Quintero is embarking on a PR campaign to claim success based on data deemed insufficient and unreliable by the scientific community.We never minimize the situation, either in the past or now. Being prepared was decisive and today we don’t ignore it either. We are facing a virus that has no cure and this is the city in Latin America with the lowest number of deaths per million inhabitants and one of the lowest number of cases per million inhabitants. But we know that there is a long way to go, that is why we cling to strategies to reduce uncertainty and that is when we incorporate the massive and sophisticated use of information technologies.Medellin Mayor Daniel QuinteroMedellin’s authorities have carried out 20,000 tests in a city of 2.4 million. This is 8,400 tests per million inhabitants.  Peru has carried out 25,000 tests per million inhabitants.In Cali, which is almost the same size as Medellin, 93 people have died of the disease, yet Quintero gladly boasts only three people in his city have died of COVID-19.Ohhhh, an app!Like in many other Colombian cities, people in Medellin are commonly ignoring the lockdown and police are not enforcing it. Any epidemiologist would say this greatly enhances the chances of widespread contagion, but Medellin’s mayor doesn’t use science.Quintero’s self-proclaimed “example to the world” is an app almost the entire city’s population allegedly downloaded.This almost absolute use of the app explains Medellin’s extraordinary low fatality rate of 0.67% and astonishing recovery rate of 56.15%, according to the mayor.Medellin’s residents have long learned that asking questions can get you killed faster than COVID-19. Colombian media have yet to ask about testing.Meanwhile, the city hall is opening factories, construction sites and shopping malls against the advice of every epidemiologist.Infections are rising, according to the few tests that are carried out, and another Medellin mayor acts as if people were statistics he can manipulate to present false positives for PR purposes. coronavirushealthcareMedellin ",https://colombiareports.com/medellins-coronavirus-approach-is-no-example-to-the-world-its-bogus-math/,"Medellin’s coronavirus approach is no ‘example to the world’, it’s bogus math"

" The mafia that has infiltrated Colombia’s military has been sending death threats to police officials who are investigating them, newspaper El Espectador reported on Saturday.The death threats sent to the officials’ Whatsapp indicate that the military mafia has identified the investigators examining evidence found during a raid in two military intelligence offices in December last year.These raids revealed that corrupt military officials had been wiretapping on the Supreme Court, journalists, NGOs and politicians, weekly Semana reported in January.Colombia’s army spied on court, politicians and journalists: reportFirst the journalists, now the policeThe criminal infiltrators made it clear to the investigators of the National Police’s intelligence unit DIJIN, which is carrying out the investigation, that the families of the police officials have also been shadowed.Don’t look for anything in the Army Command, making public what you found in the raid and the media know about is enough. Enjoy your lives, those twins, your family. Your wife is a very good accounting student, enjoy your Renault Simbol (sic) car, your daughter and your ex-cop wife.Death threatThe tactics to intimidate the police officers are similar to those used to intimidate the Semana journalists whose revelations led to the resignation of almost 20 top military officials since early 2018.In an attempt to stop the journalists from investigating, the military mafia went as far as sending condolence cards to the family members of the reporters and planted a tomb stone on the investigation leader’s car.How journalists investigating Colombia’s army were terrorized and one barely evaded assassinationAlways UribeWhile effectively an investigation into mafia infiltration in the Colombian military, the probe is formally one of three active investigations against former President Alvaro Uribe.Over the years, the Supreme Court received approximately 25 requests to investigate the former Medellin Cartel associate and political patron of President Ivan Duque.The Supreme Court magistrate who ordered the raid that triggered the biggest spying scandal since Uribe was in office last week requested to be removed from the case, claiming she had been one of the targets of the alleged military spying.It is unclear why magistrate Cristina Lombana, a former army major, only now requested to be removed from the case as her conflict of interest has been public knowledge since January already. army wiretapping scandalmilitaryNational PoliceSupreme Court ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-military-mafia-threatening-police-investigators-report/,Colombia’s military mafia threatening police investigators: report
" Colombia’s ruling party on Sunday began another attack against journalists, this time targeting the director of one of the country’s most renowned television news programs.The latest attack was initiated by one of the attorney’s of former President Alvaro Uribe, the leader of the far-right Democratic Center party, and quickly supported by party leaders.The victim this time was Cecilia Orozco, the director of Noticias Uno and a columnist of newspaper El Espectador, who has been at the forefront of exposing corruption.Uribe, his party and the government of President Ivan Duque have become increasingly aggressive against independent press that has revealed the president’s alleged involvement in rigging the 2018 elections, and the former president’s ties to paramilitary groups and the Medellin Cartel.Press freedom in Colombia deteriorated in 2019 amid persistent aggression and self-censorshipLast year, top presidential advisers helped the CD set up a group that sought to coordinate online attacks against journalists revealing corruption and politicians criticizing the government.The attacks intensified around the time Uribe had his first day in court for allegedly trying to manipulate witnesses who have testified he co-founded death squads in the 1990s.The Whatsapp group was disbanded and the “uribistas” changed tactics after they were exposed by investigative journalism collective Liga Contra el Silencio in February.How Colombia’s government officials led a political warfare campaign against journalistsApart from the government and the far-right ruling party, also the military has stepped up aggression against the freedom of the press, which is coming under more pressure than ever since the forming of the Foundation for the Freedom of Press.The military went as far as sending condolence cards to family members of journalists of weekly Semana while it was investigating the criminal and corruption activities of a mafia dissidence within the National Army.The corruption reports have put the government, the military and the ruling party under increased pressure.

" Health workers in Colombia’s capital Bogota took to the street on Thursday to demand an end to government neglect amid a surge in coronavirus infections and deaths among doctors and nurses.According to the National Health Institute, 915 health workers have been infected and 12 have died amid persistent neglect since March 6 when the first coronavirus infection was confirmed.According to the protesters, the high number of infected and dead health workers is due to the government’s failure to guarantee personal protection equipment.Additionally, the health workers claimed many have not been paid in months, despite Health Minister Fernando Ruiz’s promise to make sure back payments would be taken care of.The protesters’ concern was shared with the Bogota Citizen Watchdog and the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC).In a press conference, the directors of the two organizations said that hospitals in the capital, which has the best-equipped healthcare system in Colombia, are short of personal protection equipment and in the cases of N-95 masks are sometimes charged 1000% of these masks’ market value.Additionally, “we have received several complaints from throughout  the country about items with falsified stamps,” FMC president Sergio Isaza said.According to the Bogota Medical College, some 30 health workers a day are infected.The medical institution said on Twitter that seven health intermediaries, who Ruiz gave 24 hours to provide PPE’s earlier this month, have yet to provide masks and other equipment to protect medical personnel.The growing number of infections and deaths are also increasing tensions between the government and health workers, whose organizations have lost confidence in the minister.Health workers in several parts of the country have already resigned and, according to a recent poll by the FMC, 40% considered doing the same over the last week.The minister did not respond to either the protests or the concerns of the civil and health organizations over the alleged persistent neglect in the response to the pandemic. coronavirushealthcare ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-health-workers-protest-over-government-neglect-in-coronavirus-response/,Colombia’s health workers protest over government neglect in coronavirus response
" The first episode of the online series that promised to “morally do away with” former President Alvaro Uribe received more than 3.5 million views in the first 24 hours after its release.“Matarife” is the work of attorney and journalist Daniel Mendoza, and based on decades of investigation by one of Colombia’s most senior journalists, Gonzalo Guillen.The series’ initial success is another major blow for Uribe, who already is under investigation by the Supreme Court over his alleged manipulation of witnesses who have testified about the former president and his brother’s former death squads.Why Colombia’s former president is accused of forming bloodthirsty death squadsColombia’s traditional news outlets largely ignored the series amid pressure by Uribe’s far-right party, the Democratic Center (CD), to prevent media attention.The CD sent a letter of protest to the Colombian edition of Rolling Stone for announcing the release date of the series’ first episode and showing its trailer on the magazine’s website.It is unjustifiable that Rolling Stone should lend itself to being a sounding board and thus become an accomplice to illegal actions by irresponsible people who make defamation and slander a means of ongoing belligerent and senseless political action.Democratic CenterContrary to the far-right party’s claims, journalism is legal in Colombia. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the journalists after Uribe sued them for slander.The ruling was a turning point and — despite the absence of a conviction — made it legal to call the former president a murderer, a narco, a paramilitary and a mafioso based on available evidence and testimonies.Uribe’s cartel yearsHighlighting Uribe’s ties to organized crime, however, continues to be dangerous for Colombian journalists; Mendoza received multiple death threats ahead of Matarife’s first episode.Guillen, who is now editor-in-chief of news website La Nueva Prensa, has reported on Colombia’s mafia since the 1970s and has had a price on his head almost permanently since then.

" Colombia’s Constitutional Court allowed politicians convicted by the Supreme Court without appeal after 2013 to retroactively claim this right.The sentence followed a writ by former Agriculture Minister Andres Felipe Arias, who was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2014 over the misappropriation of $25 million in agricultural subsidies.While granting Arias his right to appeal, the court stressed that the sentence remained valid and the former minister must appeal his sentence while imprisoned.Until a reform in 2018, privileged crime suspects like ministers, lawmakers and governors were tried and sentenced by the Supreme Court without the right to appeal.Arias initially fled to the United States to evade imprisonment, but was sent back to face justice after a US judge rejected the former minister’s claim he was the victim of political persecution.Arias and his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, have since tried to secure the former minister’s right to appeal, respectively in court and in Congress.While Uribe sought to change the law that would allow politicians convicted since 1986 to appeal their sentences, the Constitutional Court ruled only politicians convicted after January 30, 2014 could do so.The Supreme Court said it “adheres to, but disagrees with” the Constitutional Court sentence and said the other high court would be responsible if the provisional sentence disrupted the rule of law.With the unconditional defense of the country’s institutionality that characterizes it, the Supreme Court of Justice will comply with the order. The Constitutional Court is responsible for the impact of the unsuspected consequences on the rule of law of this particular decision.Supreme CourtAccording to the Supreme Court, the decision in favor of Arias “sets a dangerous precedent of uncertainty in ordinary jurisdiction and legal insecurity in criminal justice,” claiming it allowed a convicted criminal to appeal a decision that at the time was perfectly valid, according to the constitution.According to newspaper El Espectador, the decision could enable 32 politicians who were convicted between 2014 and the 2018 installment of the Supreme Court’s Appeals Chamber to appeal their conviction.

" The assassinations of Colombia’s social leaders saw a dramatic rise in the first four months of 2020 compared to the same period last year, according to two conflict monitors.In its latest report on armed conflict, Fundacion Ideas de la Paz (FIP) said the killing of human rights defenders and community leaders increased 53%.According to conflict monitor Indepaz, which uses a different definition of what is a social leader, killings went up 23% from 67 in the first four months of 2019 to 87 in the first four months of this year.According to FIP, the deadliest provinces for social leaders continue to be Cauca and Antioquia. A turf war between FARC dissidents and narcos put the southern Putumayo province also in the top three.Homicides in general dropped 16%, according to the conflict monitor. According to the Defense Ministry, this drop is almost entirely due a drop in homicides during a lockdown that has been in place since March 25.The coronavirus pandemic that triggered the lockdown has not increased the safety of the social leaders, but allowed illegal armed groups to use the emergency situation to increase their territorial control, according to both the FLIP and Indepaz.In some cases, illegal armed groups are using the absence of the state to impose their own stay at home orders, effectively demonstrating they are the authority.Some illegal armed groups have ordered restrictions and reinforced isolation, on the grounds that they prevent the spread of the virus; in other cases, armed factions have increased their actions against leaders and communities.Fundacion Ideas para la PazThe most active of these groups were the ELN guerrilla group and dissidents of the demobilized FARC guerrilla group.The security forces’ have not reduced their capacity to combat illegal armed groups, according to FIP, which also registered an increase in attacks by the military, mainly against the paramilitary AGC.Despite the increase in combat, the military reported a decrease in combat kills, injured enemy combatants and demobilized members of illegal armed groups after the order to double these numbers was withdrawn. armed conflictFIPpolitical violencesocial leaders ",https://colombiareports.com/violence-against-colombias-human-rights-defenders-see-dramatic-increase-report/,Violence against Colombia’s human rights defenders sees dramatic increase: report

The evidence against the Uribe crime family has been piling up since 1984 that they are like 20 elephants in the room and have the political patron of President Ivan Duque begging the Supreme Court not to throw him in jail already.Uribe has had the worst luck with the law as he keeps suing journalists who break the rules over “slander” or “infamy,” filling the courthouse with evidence of his family’s criminal empire.The former president introduced the “rule of opinion” that would allow public opinion Uribe has been manipulating for decades to overrule the rule of law, but this turned out to be unconstitutional.The irony“The Messiah” is approximately 24 hours away from having his moral authority taken through a meat grinder, ironically by a journalist who spends more time having sex with his girlfriends than Uribe and his “good Colombians” spend in church.The problem with Mendoza is that he wasn’t just trained by Gonzalo Guillen, arguably the country’s most respected journalist, he has a law degree.This has become increasingly terrifying for Uribe as Guillen and Mendoza have not just won every single court case against the former president, their journalism is morally destroying Uribe’s attorneys and getting them eerily close to prison.The two have had enough of Uribe, his self-proclaimed moral rectitude and the death threats. Having done away with the former President’s lawyers, Mendoza will on Wednesday begin to destroy Uribe in his non-fiction online TV series “Matarife.”More than 100,000 Colombians have subscribed to his YouTube Channel, eager to see how the libertine punk will rip Uribe to shreds.Countless others have subscribed to special Whatsapp and Telegram groups and are ready to upload the video, if Uribe is able to take it down.The former president is cornered. If he takes down the video, it will be uploaded again hundredfold. Even if his attorneys weren’t already with one foot in the door, they wouldn’t dare make a move.The last time “The Messiah” sued the punk, Mendoza appeared in court with such an abundance of evidence Uribe was forced to withdraw the lawsuit or risk life in prison.

" While Colombia’s government is trying to reopen shopping malls, a growing number of voices are urging that food security requires urgent action to prevent widespread hunger.The United Nations, former ministers, food suppliers and farmers are all ringing the alarm, and not because they are concerned about new sneakers, but the growing threat of famine.Food security in urban areas “critical”With unemployment expected to skyrocket, the United Nations Humanitarian organization, OCHA, warned for price hikes in food in Bogota and Medellin, saying the lack of food is security has become critical for the growing number of poor in the city.There are concerns about the food security and income of vulnerable families working informally and without social security guarantees. In Colombia, tensions are increasing in areas with vulnerable populations living in poverty in several cities, where people’s livelihoods depend on informal work on the street. Despite the efforts being made, many families are unable to access necessary livelihoods or assistance.OCHASocial distancing measures imposed on the urban food distribution centers are additionally threatening the effective distribution of food in the cities and surrounding areas, according to the director of political science think tank ICP, Andres Espinosa.Measures of Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez to reduce personnel in food distribution center Corabastos to 35% “would put the production chain made up of small, medium and large production companies and the Colombian peasantry, as well as the transport, logistics, distribution, supply and consumption of foodstuffs in the central region of the country at risk.”Farmers want to feed and to eatFarmers have been urging for measures that would allow them not just provide for their families, but access to the market.Through the Coalition of Colombia’s Social Organizations (COMOSOC), they warned “the outlook is alarming” and warned that the dependency of food imports while the peso is cheap “will mean higher prices for imported food, or food with a high component of external inputs.”Food vulnerability is not only a rural problem. Thousands of Colombians today are going hungry in the cities. It is therefore necessary to address the proposals of the peasantry to build bridges between rural producers and urban consumers, with priority given to the most vulnerable sectors.COMOSOCThe government of President Ivan Duque recently issued a decree to remove tariffs on basic food products like corn and soy to make food production cheaper.Small farmers receive support from the big gunsDuque’s decree was already opposed by the small farmers who claimed food imports are running them out of business, but they are now surprisingly receiving the support of former Defense Minister Gabriel Silva, former Agriculture Minister Luis Arango and banker Paulo Emilo Rivas.Silva went as far as saying that foreign subsidized food products are “market neo-imperialism” and urged that a “defensive strategy when it comes to the protection of national production and labor must become priority” in his column in newspaper El Tiempo.There is virtually no sector of the world economy that jumps into the limelight without the armor provided with an avalanche of government subsidies that neutralize the possibilities of those who, in good faith and without official support, try to access the international market.Former Defense Minister Gabriel SilvaFormer Agriculture Minister Luis Arango who said that “depending on foreign food supplies is a risk amid a growing protectionist trend in global trade.Like the farmers, Rivas of the farmers’bank Contactar urged investment in rural infrastructure that facilitate farmers’ access to the market.It is fundamental that the producers of the Colombian countryside know the instruments available to face the crisis and in case they need them, access to relief and government aid, but it is also fundamental to give an immediate solution to their current and primary deficiencies such as the difficulty of cultivating, harvesting, selling and transporting their products.Banker Pablo Emilio RivasWhile Duque is trying to reopen shopping malls, both social organization and political heavyweights are urging for policies to prevent hunger.The government may not be taking part, but social organizations and political heavyweights have begun an existential debate about a post-coronavirus economy.The disagreements about the shape of this economy are profound, but the shared concern is not about sneakers, it is about food. agricultureeconomy ",https://colombiareports.com/the-big-think-should-colombia-prioritize-food-or-new-sneakers/,The big think: should Colombia prioritize food or new sneakers?
" Colombia plans to extend its international air travel ban until the end of the current health emergency on August 31, the country’s transport minister said Wednesday.Transport Minister Angela Maria Orozco made the announcement days after President Ivan Duque discarded reopening the country’s international airports “on the short term.”Colombia discards international flights ‘in the short term’ amid doubts about restarting economyWhether international air travel will be reestablished after that date depends on whether the government lifts the health emergency in place to deal with the coronavirus, the minister told Blu Radio.The restriction on international air transport goes hand in hand with the health emergency, i.e. until 31 August. Until that date, international flights are not expected to be resumed.Transport Minister Angela Maria OrozcoColombia’s government suspended all commercial air travel on March 23, two days before the country entered a lockdown.Since then, only cargo flights and humanitarian flights to repatriate foreigners and nationals have been allowed.Internal flights might resume in July, said Orzoco, whose government has been trying to reactivate the economy while trying to avoid a sudden surge in coronavirus infections that could collapse the country’s fragile healthcare system.The success of this effort will determine whether Duque will be able to lift the national emergency or will be forced to extend it.So far, relaxations of economic activity have accelerated confirmed coronavirus cases increasingly adding pressure to the healthcare system.The pandemic and its economic consequences forced the country’s largest airliner, Avianca, to file for bankruptcy in the US.Colombia’s Avianca goes bankruptThe transport minister is considerably more optimistic about the resumption of international air travel than the World Travel Organization (WTO).Almost three quarters of the WTO’s expert panel do not expect the recovery of international air travel until after October. Almost 40% of the experts believe the recovery of international air travel won’t start until next year. air travelcoronavirusnewslettertourism ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-to-extend-international-air-travel-ban-until-august-31/,Colombia to extend international air travel ban until August 31
" Colombia’s healthcare system has been on the brink of collapse for more than a decade. Efforts to allow the system to respond to the coronavirus pandemic were corrupted immediately.Like every country, Colombia has its own particular healthcare system, which in the case of the South American country is public and supposed to provide universal healthcare.This system has never worked for two main reasons; private healthcare intermediaries disappearing funds and politicians receiving kickbacks from private contractors.Healthcare workers, meanwhile, are expected to risk their lives on a freelance basis if they are paid at all, and could lose their job if they are infected by the coronavirus.Colombia’s health workers unprotected, patients without treatment: watchdogsHealthcare racket 1 | the intermediariesThe coronavirus pandemic has made it painfully evident how the rackets crippling the system work.After declaring a health emergency in mid-March, President Ivan Duque vowed a $1.5 billion capital injection that would cancel the private health intermediaries’ debts to hospitals who in turn would be able to pay their personnel’s back payments.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz sent this money to the health intermediaries, after which it disappeared.Ruiz told Congress last week he had to transfer an extra $500,000 directly to the hospitals so they could cancel their debts with their providers and another $120 million directly to health workers who hadn’t been paid since January.The Superintendency for Health, SuperSalud, has yet to inquire where the $1.5 billion has gone.The Comptroller’s Office and the Inspector General’s Office had to force SuperSalud in February to intervene in health intermediary Medimas, one of the recipients of the $1.5 billion, for refusing to provide healthcare to 300,000 of its 2.5 million clients.Despite its clients compulsory payments and the extra government funds, “Medimas did not have the liquid resources to meet its payment obligations in the short, medium and long term,” the watchdog concluded last week.The intermediary was forced to end operations in eight of Colombia’s 32 provinces without anyone inquiring where their money had gone.According to newspaper El Espectador, only 18 of 40 intermediaries operate without some kind of sanction. Five have been liquidated since January last year.Colombia shuts down 5th intermediary this year as healthcare system crumblesHealthcare racket 2 | the capitalistsThe pandemic exposed a second common racket, which has destroyed democracy, deprives cities of entire healthcare systems and is currently killing people in the northern city of Cartagena.While the execution is often sophisticated, the racket in itself is simple; capitalists “invest” in politicians who bribe potential voters. Once in office, the politicians grant their investors contracts to, for example, build hospitals that are never built.The capitalists get their investment back, the politicians get their cut and the voters can go fuck themselves. If not assassinated, any politician who exposes the corruption can expect public vilification by the media owned by the capitalists.For example, Cartagena Mayor William Dau called his city’s notoriously corrupt council members “corrupt fucking thugs” after finding at least five hospitals in ruins earlier this year.According to local newspaper La Libertad, “this must be rejected fiercely,” not referring to the corruption that is now killing dozens, but the mayor for cursing at criminals “that deserve the same respect the mayor demands.”Cartagena mayor praised over expletive-laden tirade over stolen health fundsHealthcare racket 3 | the hospital directorsA similar racket between elected officials, particularly governors, and their “investors” is about embezzling hospital budgets.For reasons unbeknownst to man, governors get to cherry pick public hospital directors, often choosing the capitalists that financed their campaigns or people from their inner circle.This racket has already killed dozens in the southeastern town of Leticia where, according to the local comptroller, Governor Jesus Galindo and the hospital director went on an embezzlement and robbery binge until SuperSalud was forced to remove him last month.While the coronavirus was ravaging through the town, the health minister himself jumped in, in an attempt to cover up the mess caused by the government ally who allegedly stole his province’s coronavirus emergency funds.Political news website La Silla Vacia last week reported that at least nine governors gave their friends control over their public hospital funds in the middle of the coronavirus crisis.Colombia’s healthcare show: ‘If you get sick, you die and that’s the truth’ corruptionhealthcare ",https://colombiareports.com/the-rackets-that-put-colombias-healthcare-system-on-the-brink-of-collapse/,The rackets that put Colombia’s healthcare system on the brink of collapse
" Colombia is nowhere near “beating COVID-19,” but ranked in the problem category of countries that need to take action against the coronavirus pandemic, according to a comparative study.In the comparative study of website endcoronavirus.org, the South American country fell in the “countries that need to take action” category based on the numbers of reported cases.The government of President Ivan Duque has failed to take website’s recommended actions that would allow the country to “go back to normal.”In fact, the government’s actions to reactivate the economy are diametrically opposed to the recommendations “to win” and have so far only led to an apparent acceleration of the virus’s spread.As metric, the website used a 10-day average of countries’ daily registered cases to determine where a country is “beating” the pandemic, “nearly there,” or “need to take action.”According to the National Health Institute, Colombia registered on average 662.4 new cases per day over the past 10 days compared to 524.8 the week before.Active coronavirus infections in ColombiaSource: National Health InstituteThis registered increase could be due to the government’s attempts to increase testing. According to Cali mayor Jorge Ospina, however, the acceleration of registered cases in his city is because of the government’s rush to reopen before having the virus under control.The mayor of Colombia’s third largest city and his counterparts have been slowing down the government’s attempts to reactivate economic activity by applying strict standards on health and hygiene on businesses that want to restart activity.After Duque implied he would end a national lockdown on June 1 on Tuesday, Ospina announced a local lockdown in an attempt to prevent the collapse of his city’s healthcare system.The government’s failure to effectively bolster the country’s healthcare system has already caused the collapse of healthcare in the southeastern Amazonas province and threatens to do the same in Cali and multiple port cities. coronavirusnewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-among-worlds-worst-performers-in-beating-covid-19/,Colombia among world’s worst performers in ‘beating COVID-19’
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque extended his country’s stay at home order until May 31 and a health emergency until August 31 as accelerating coronavirus infections put hospitals on the brink of collapse.In the extra week of lockdown he would announce “fundamental measures” ahead of the reopening of certain retail establishments in June, Duque announced on Tuesday.The compulsory preventive isolation, as we have imposed to date, will be extended until 31 May. We are going to earn a week that is very important, because in that week we will be taking fundamental measures in terms of adapting to new cycles.President Ivan DuqueCome June, Duque said he would implement an “intelligent lockdown” that would allow the relaxation of restriction of movement measures, based on regional conditions.The current lockdown, that took force on May 11, already contains a clause that allows for mayors and governments in areas where there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus to request a relaxation of restrictions.These regional relaxation measures will be expanded “gradually, of course, recognizing the particularities of provinces and cities, such as population density and the dynamics of the pandemic in these places. The guideline in this time is to continue taking a step forward to recover productive life in issues such as trade, with capacity controls.”Duque failed to announce any measures to prepare the country’s fragile healthcare system for the expected surge in infections that caused the collapse of healthcare in the southeast of the country and threatens to collapse healthcare in cities like Cartagena and Cali, according to local authorities.The president and other government officials have made all kinds of announcements during the crisis that ultimately were either discarded, severely limited or made impossible by lower governments.Duque’s failure to bolster the country’s healthcare capacity and prevent hunger has caused major tensions between the national government,  the medical community, and governors and mayors. coronavirusIvan Duquequarantine ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-extends-lockdown-until-may-31-and-health-emergency-until-august-31/,Colombia extends lockdown until May 31 and health emergency until August 31

" Colombia’s Supreme Court magistrate Cristina Lombana seems to have a special gift to accidentally get her allegedly criminal former army buddies in legal trouble.Since President Ivan Duque swore in Lombana in October 2018, the judge not once has made the headlines for serving justice, and made plenty making her look like a tit.In the former major’s defense, hardly anyone sworn in by Duque seems to have a clue what they’re doing.Moreover, Lombana’s adapting to a grown ups’ court would be a challenge for any former member of Colombia’s notoriously ineffective military justice system.Having spent years securing impunity for members of the military, the magistrate is now getting them in trouble while doing everything she can to frustrate the case against former President Alvaro Uribe.Why is everything going wrong?Former President Alvaro Uribe (Image: Colprensa)Lombana has been humiliated so often that any person with a minor sense of empathy would feel sorry for her.It took journalists little to no effort to expose  she forgot to tell the court she used to be married to a war criminal and used to work for the defense attorney of Uribe, who is investigated by the court.Despite her fierce resistance, Lombana’s colleagues banned the magistrate from coming even close to pending ongoing investigations into the former Medellin Cartel associate.The victim of Uribe’s alleged fraud and bribery practices, Senator Ivan Cepeda, is now demanding disciplinary actions against Lombana for “illegally interfering in the due course of justice.”Colombia’s most controversial Supreme Court magistrate married convicted war criminalTrying to prevent Uribe from going to jail?Senator Ivan Cepeda (Image: Patriotic March)In an apparent attempt to prevent being reduced to furniture, Lombana used a far right conspiracy to try to recuse magistrate Cesar Reyes in October last year, claiming that the magistrate who was investigating Uribe was friends with Cepeda’s wife.As per usual, Lombana bit the dust and the court began pulling more Uribe cases away from her while Reyes continued his investigation.As if her only job was to prevent Uribe going to prison, Lombana again tried to question her colleagues’ impartiality last month using the same argument. Reyes politely told his colleague to get lost.Controversial Supreme Court judge orders corruption investigation into colleagueEyes wide openRetired General Nicasio Martinez (Image: National Army)Lombana finally got something to do on December 17 last year when she received an anonymous email about illegal wiretapping practices by of her former employer, the military, that could compromise the former Medellin Cartel associate.The email had been ignored by her colleagues, but Lombana ordered  a raid first thing in the morning on December 18.Imagine her disappointment finding no information on Uribe, but enough for army chief Nicacio Martinez to resign almost immediately.Because the Supreme Court is only allowed to investigate senators and governors, the magistrate was forced to leave the investigation to the Inspector General and the prosecution.Lombana was forced to go back to pestering her colleaguesOn Saturday, Semana published that as many as 16 generals and more than 200 other members of the military were accused of  criminal activity thanks to the scandal the magistrate accidentally triggered.Thirteen of her former colleagues had already been sacked.Operation Baton: Colombia’s most epic military corruption probe in history?Someone apparently set a trap for Lombana, the magistrate walking in with her eyes wide open.A year and a half after taking office,  Lombana has gotten nowhere in keeping Uribe out of prison, but was elementary in purging the alleged “uribista” criminals from the military.

" Colombia’s military has been so busy covering up corruption, it never filed criminal charges against an army general who worked for guerrillas and FARC dissidents for more than a decade.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo last week announced the prosecution would investigate 13 army officials on corruption charges as a result of the so-called “Operation Baton.”Trujillo refused to say who would be investigated and forgot to mention that this 2017 counterintelligence operation found evidence that not 13, but  266  army officials, including 16 generals, had engaged in corruption.The defense minister seems adamant in continuing the cover-up practices of former National Army commander Nicacio Martinez, the alleged war criminal who suspended the corruption investigation after he was appointed by President Ivan Duque in December 2018.Trujillo has a good reason.The National Army’s corruption and ineptitude are of such epic proportions, the defense minister is lucky the American military isn’t particularly intelligent either or US Congress would’ve pulled funding ages ago.Operation Baton: Colombia’s most epic military corruption probe in history?Army applying lower standards than designated terrorist groupWhile Operation Baton revealed ties between generals and all kinds of illegal armed groups and narcos, the one of an anonymous 8th Division commander beats them all.This general, whose name has not been revealed, allegedly received at least $500,000 from former FARC commander “Grannobles” who is wanted by the US Department of Justice for kidnapping and murdering three American citizens in 1999.Additionally, the counterintelligence report said, the army commander “leaked information to armed groups, putting the physical integrity of the troops at risk and sabotaging the development of military operations.”The guerrillas apparently upheld higher moral standards than the National Army. The only reason “Grannobles” wasn’t executed over his debauchery was because he is the brother of “Mono Jojoy,” the FARC’s late military chief.The general stayed and began working for the ELN and dissident guerrillas after the FARC’s demobilization in 2017.It took a guerrilla to wake up the armyThe military didn’t even notice the general had been in bed with the guerrillas until after the FARC’s demobilization and only because a former guerrilla warned them the top commander had been working for the guerrillas since the 1990’s.Eighteen years of failed military operations apparently raised little suspicion as the corrupt commander rose through the ranks from captain to general.Even when the demobilized former radio operator of Mono Jojoy told the investigators about the general’s rampant corruption, she had to undergo multiple lie detector tests before counterintelligence got the plot.When the prosecution’s Financial Crimes unit confirmed that the commander was suspiciously wealthy, the counterintelligence unit discovered he had not just worked for the FARC, but also received money from the ELN and the FARC dissidents.The general was called in and asked to resign to avoid a scandal. According to Semana, the prosecution received the evidence of the army commander’s treason and corruption, but also preferred to push it under the rug.Even Semana wouldn’t reveal the name of the general “in order not to hinder the investigations” as if it was making progress.Government not done protecting the traitorsAfter Duque appointed Martinez commander, the former Inspector General of the army embarked on one of the biggest cover-ups in the history of the institution.After appointing General Eduardo Quiros as Counterintelligence chief, and receiving the report demonstrating terrorist groups apply higher moral standards than Colombia’s “heroes,” the army command went after the “snitches” instead of the alleged traitors, narcos and thieves.The witch hunt sunk the army in crisis as honest commanders were getting sacked while a clique of alleged criminals were appointed to top positions.Quiros got caught, but instead of being sacked he was promoted and the family of the Semana editor whose team had exposed the general’s criminal behavior received death threats while other journalists become military targets.Meanwhile, guerrillas were gaining almost more terrain than the army’s lost reputation, credibility and morale.If the defense minister fails to further cover up the reported criminal activity, the American government might find out. armed conflictcorruptionFARCmilitary ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-protecting-general-who-worked-for-guerrillas-for-18-years/,Colombia protecting general who worked for guerrillas for 18 years
" Presumed members of Colombia’s far-right group “Aguilas Negras” said on Saturday they were founded by “important national personalities” in a death threat sent to politicians, a unionist and a journalist.In the death threat, the “reorganized” group clarified their elusive origins in a letter mailed to the men and woman they believed to be preparing peace talks with the country’s last-standing guerrilla group, the ELN.The death threat did not have the Aguilas Negras’ logo, but called itself the “Capital Bloc (Reorganized),” making it impossible to check the veracity or estimate the seriousness of the threat.Death threat recipientsSenator Alexander Lopez (Democratic Pole)Former Labor Minister and ambassador Carlos Bula (democratic Pole)Union leader Hernando Hernandez (USO)Journalist Patricia Lara (El Espectador)The Aguilas Negras long consisted of extremist groups within the security forces, specifically the 4th Brigade in Medellin, presumably tied with members of regional elites.The group or collective have made it no secret they are admirers of President Ivan Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.Everybody in Colombia can guess who the Aguilas Negras are, except the Aguilas NegrasThe death threat’s claim they were formed by “important national personalities’ contradicts analysts’ presumptions the group has no hierarchy.The death threat claimed, however, that “we are the military arm of a political apparatus and are squads with a military-political formation.”The authors of the threat said “we dissolved ourselves when the communist offensive of the government of [former President Juan Manuel] Santos impeded our operations.”This contradicts with the fact that death threats signed by the Aguilas Negras were also sent during the Santos administrationLopez sent a letter to Duque and the prosecution, demanding an investigation into the group that has been threatening human rights defenders for years with absolute impunity.Duque has so far neglected to meet his obligation to formulate legislation to dismantle paramilitary groups like the “Aguilas Negras” that traditionally form from alliances between the private sector and the security forces.

" Colombia’s third largest city, Cali, and port city Cartagena rang the alarm as the country’s healthcare system appears to slowly be falling apart because of the coronavirus pandemic.An explosive increase in confirmed infections in Colombia’s third largest economy, as well as in one of its major ports, follow the trend previously registered in remote cities like Leticia in the southeast and Tumaco in the southwest.While healthcare is virtually non-existent in the smaller cities, this cannot be said about Cali and Cartagena.The only coincidence is that healthcare in all these cities has been bled dry by corruption and mismanagement for years, while promised government aid to bolster healthcare never arrived in the hospitals and with the medical personnel.One week after promising health supplies to southeast Colombia, government vows aid to bury the deadCali: economic reactivation, sex parties and migrant protestsScreenshot: YouTube)According to the National Health Institute, Cali saw confirmed infections rise from 1,076 last week to 1,276 on Saturday following the reactivation of part of the economy and general chaos caused by locals holding clandestine sex parties, as well as by mass protests by Venezuelan migrants wanting to go home.At least 70 people have died of COVID-19 in the city since the coronavirus was first confirmed in Colombia on March 6. This is more than 12% of all confirmed fatalities in the country.Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina has had trouble maintaining public order, and enforcing a lockdown in particular. National government pushes to reactivate the economy have further aggravated the problem in the city of 2.5 million.“I am afraid that the opening and relaxation of the quarantine is beginning to manifest itself with accelerated contagion,” said Ospina, who is a physician.Cali’s mayor and others warned President Ivan Duque about what they perceive as a premature reactivation of the economy and a lack of response to bolster healthcare that has eroded because of corruption for years.Cartagena: corruption, corruption and corruptionCartagena Mayor William Dau (Image: Caracol)Cartagena Mayor William Dau inherited one of the most corrupt cities in Colombia where the hospitals have long been a piñata for local politicians.While Dau is in charge of responding to the 1,070 infections reported on Saturday — double that of last week — multiple of the port city’s hospitals are in ruins.Tensions between the anti-corruption mayor and the city council long run by the local elite have reached extraordinary levels.Councilwoman Liliana Suarez warned the mayor in February that “if we have to pull our guns in order to kill, we will.”Dau embarked on an expletive-laden tirade over the city council’s incessant corruption, which earned him a standing ovation from the locals last month.Cartagena mayor praised over expletive-laden tirade over stolen health fundsThe mayor has asked the national government to provide emergency medical facilities ahead of what could be an impending disaster.The increasingly uncontrollable situation in the country appears to have woken up President Ivan Duque who on Saturday for the first time refused to push economic reactivation.The president said nothing about about humanitarian aid for those affected by the lockdown he declared on March 25 or extra measures to support healthcare.

" The Colombian government thought it could outsmart farmers by taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to resume the aerial spraying of coca. Turns out farmers aren’t stupid.In the latest attempt to resume areal fumigation, the National Environmental Licensing Agency (ANLA) tried to obtain the compulsory approval of farming communities through online consultations in areas on lockdown and without internet.A group of farmers from the southwestern Nariño province successfully sued the ANLA, which was ordered to suspend the consultations while the judge considers their legality.The decision is the latest blow for President Ivan Duque, who said last year he would resume the controversial practice that was banned in 2015 in a matter of weeks.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo hasn’t been able to aerially fumigate one square inch, and the government’s broadly rejected counternarcotics policy — as forewarned — is turning out to be one big failure.Nothing going rightUnder pressure from US President Donald Trump, Duque and Trujillo opted for stepping up forced eradication and the resumption of aerial fumigation.The crop substitution program, part of a peace process that has been shunned both by Washington DC and Bogota, was all but abandoned.Consequently, the White House was forced to admit that Colombia’s cocaine production reached a record high in 2019.To avoid the bilateral counternarcotics policy becoming an even bigger failure than predicted, Trujillo and his US counterpart Mark Esper agreed to step up forced eradication 38% to a record 130,000 hectares this year.As if they were jinxed, forced eradication in the first quarter of 2020 dropped 29% compared to last yest.This can only get worseThe United Nations is expect to release its annual report on coca cultivation in Colombia within months, just in time to confirm that Trump’s counternarcotics policy in Colombia is a tragic disaster.To make things worse, the coronavirus pandemic is causing a massive spike in Colombia’s unemployment rate, a surge in the price of gold and the depletion of the government’s treasury.This could incentivize farmers to grow even more coca, increase illegal armed groups’ revenue and bankrupt the government.Colombia’s opposition and the country’s powerful peace movement have been urging the government to implement the 2016 peace deal with demobilized FARC guerrillas, including the crop substitution program, to prevent the weakened state being confronted by strengthened illegal armed groups.The government has been deaf to these calls, despite everything indicating that the current drug policy can only go wrong. aerial fumigationcoca cultivationDrug policydrug trafficking ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-crumbling-drug-policy-farmers-thwart-attempt-to-resume-aerial-spraying-of-coca/,Colombia’s crumbling drug policy: farmers thwart attempt to resume aerial spraying of coca
" A paramilitary group from northern Colombia had access to classified information from Colombian and international counternarcotics agencies allowing it to avoid drug seizures, according to Noticias Uno.According to the the news program, authorities found out that the Pachenca gang had access to the classified information during a raid in Dibullla, a coastal town in the northern La Guajira province.The Pachenca gang, which is part of the so-called Sierra Nevada Self-Defense Conquerors (ACSN), controls many of the Caribbean drug trafficking routes between the coastal city of Santa Marta and the Venezuelan border.One step, or nautical mile, ahead of the authoritiesAfter the raid on March 13, police reported they had seized a shipment of 480 metric kilos of cocaine and two speedboats presumably meant to traffic the drugs northward.Ten members of the paramilitary group were arrested, local media reported at the time.What the authorities did not report was that they also found documents of Military Intelligence, and the American and Panamanian Navy’s.The documents reportedly described the location and routes of the multinational counternarcotics missions, allowing the narcos to avoid the seizure of drug shipments while en route to the United States.Authorities have yet to find out how the narcos of the regional paramilitary group were able to obtain classified counternarcotics documents of three countries.The narco history of Colombia’s security forces | Part 1: Santa MartaWho are the ACSN?The ACSN merged with the Santa Marta-based Pachenca drug gang in 2019 in a mutual attempt to prevent the Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces (AGC), a dissident group of the now-defunct AUC paramilitary group, taking control over the region.The Pachenca gang used to be a partner of the AGC until the death of Pachenca leader “Chucho Mercancia” and an alleged feud over a lost drug shipment in 2019 triggered a turf war.Before July last year, the paramilitary group that is alleged to also have ties to the region’s private sector, had never been heard of.In their first statement, the group said it was an “armed force that watches over the tranquillity and well-being of thousands of peasant meals. We will continue to fight as long as any force other than the state tries to enter the territory.”The group, which includes some of the many children of extradited AUC commander Hernan Giraldo, explicitly said it was protecting the region from incursions from the AGC and the leftist ELN guerrilla group.How one of Colombia’s biggest sexual predators built a network of power through rapeIn their second statement on Christmas Eve last year, the ACSN said they want to  “provide a social service to the community and our neighbors.”First, we inform the righteous citizens, social and political leaders that they should not be afraid. We say this so that peace and calm that this region has always enjoyed can reign again. In the same vein, we inform that we are not against the national or municipal authorities, on the contrary, we want to provide a social service to the community and our neighbors.ACSNThe group also tries to maintain control over the drug trafficking routes on the eastern side of Colombia’s Caribbean coast that fell into the hands of the Pachenca gang after the arrest of jailed drug trafficker Marquitos Figuroa in 2015.

" The United States government further complicated the future of peace in Colombia on Wednesday, adding Cuba to its list of non-cooperative countries in counter-terrorism efforts for not extraditing ELN peace negotiators.According to the US Department of State, “Cuba’s refusal to productively engage with the Colombian government demonstrates that it is not cooperating with U.S. work to support Colombia’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace, security, and opportunity for its people.”Members of the ELN, who traveled to Havana to conduct peace talks with the Colombian government in 2017, remained in Cuba in 2019.  Citing peace negotiation protocols, Cuba refused Colombia’s request to extradite ten ELN leaders living in Havana after the group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy that killed 22 people and injured more than 60 others. As the United States maintains an enduring security partnership with Colombia and shares with Colombia the important counterterrorism objective of combating organizations like the ELN, Cuba’s refusal to productively engage with the Colombian government demonstrates that it is not cooperating with U.S. work to support Colombia’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace, security, and opportunity for its people.United States Department of StateColombia’s Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos immediately said that the United States’ refusal to recognize the international agreements that don’t allow Cuba to extradite the ELN peace negotiators are a major support for Colombia to do the same.Cuba, together with other guarantors of the peace talks, agreed with the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos to guarantee the safe return of the guerrilla leaders in 2016 in the event peace talks broke down.The government of President Ivan Duque, who suspended the talks when taking office in August 2018, has claimed it is not bound to international agreements made by previous governments.Following the 2019 terrorist attack on a police academy in Bogota, Duque demanded the extradition of the peace negotiators, claiming they were involved in the car bomb attack carried out by an ELN guerrilla unit.The government of US President Donald Trump is the only one that supports Colombia’s claim it can unilaterally pull out of international agreements.The government of Norway, another guarantor country, has stressed that guarantor countries’ violation of international agreements would not only complicate peace talks in Colombia, but anywhere.The State Department’s decision is the latest blow of the administration of President Donald Trump to peace in Colombia; in 2018, the US Justice Department demanded the extradition of now-fugitive FARC leader “Jesus Santrich” on questionable claims he sought to traffic drugs. armed conflictCubaELNpeace talksterrorismUnited States ",https://colombiareports.com/us-further-complicates-prospects-for-peace-in-colombia/,US further complicates prospects for peace in Colombia
" The United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) supports an urgent guaranteed minimum income (GMI) as proposed in Colombia’s senate.The proposal was coined by some 50 senators earlier this week as a temporary measure to prevent hunger and lift the burden on businesses as an urgent response to the coronavirus crisis.Colombia considering guaranteed minimum income as famine looms‘Neo-liberal’ economy out of grace, welfare state back on tableIn a virtual press conference, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Barcena took the proposal even further and urged countries in the region to consider making the GMI a permanent element of their social policies.The ECLAC chief did propose a GMI lower than the one proposed in Colombia’s congress that would cost 4% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The regional economic commission proposed not to exceed 2.8%.According to Barcena, the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic “has exposed structural problems in the economic model and failings of social protection systems and welfare schemes” that require an urgent and radical reform.Last month, the ECLAC had already warned that old economic recovery models would not work because of the record-low commodity prices.The pandemic has exposed structural problems in the economic model and failings of social protection systems and welfare schemes that are very costly to us today. Hence, we must move towards the creation of a welfare State based on a new social compact that takes into account fiscal, social and production-related matters.ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia BarcenaPriority: fighting hungerWithout radical measures, the ECLAC said it feared than people living below the poverty line in Colombia could go from 29% in 2019 to between 30.4% and 32.5% this year.Extreme poverty would affect between 11.3% and 12.7% percent of the population by the end of this year compared to 10.3%.The ECLAC estimated that the upper-middle class and the country’s richest are at the least risk of being affected by the crisis that would be further expanding the wealth gap in the region.Therefore, income, food security and basic services must be guaranteed to a large group of people whose situation has become extremely vulnerable and who were not necessarily included in existing social programs before the pandemic.ECLACAccording to the World Food Program, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador are facing imminent famine, with unforeseen consequences for, for example, public security and social stability.More than half of Venezuela’s refugees in Colombia at risk of starvation: UNGroups believed to suffer most from economic downturnWomenLower and lower-middle classesInformal workersDomestic employeesChildren and teenagersYoung adultsElderly citizensRural communitiesIndigenous peoplesPeople of African descentDisabled peopleMigrantsHomeless peopleHow these groups will sufferPhysical and mental healthNutritionEducationLabor incomeChild laborAccess to basis servicesUnpaid care workDomestic violence(Source: ECLAC)A reshuffling of global economic policiesThe ECLAC expects more protectionist policies, for example, in the United States, which — apart from the record-low commodity prices — would make exports hardly efficient for the region’s economic activity.The economic commission had already called for more regional economic cooperation within Latin America and strengthening ties with Europe.Constructing a welfare state and universal social protection systems is key to avoiding another lost decade. The international financial crisis of 2008 showed the importance of spending and social policies aimed at moderating the effects of the crisis in the real economies and curb the rise in unemployment and poverty. In contrast, the debt crisis of the 1980s led to very significant increases in the levels of poverty. It took 25 years for the region to return to pre-crisis poverty levels.ECLACTo prevent that the imminent economic collapse disintegrates societies, the ECLAC urged not to only implement radically new economic policies, but to come to new fiscal agreements and lobby a renegotiation of debt payments with developed nations. coronavirusECLACeconomic crisisguaranteed minimum incomeUnited Nations ",https://colombiareports.com/un-economic-commission-backs-guaranteed-minimum-income-in-colombia/,UN economic commission backs guaranteed minimum income in Colombia
" Many Colombians may have no food, but that doesn’t mean their Ambassador to Geneva can’t have lunch that could sustain two families for a month for lunch.One cannot form an accurate picture of Colombia without taking Ambassador Adriana del Rosario Mendoza, who represents her country at the United Nations Human Rights Council, into account.During the lockdown, 3 million Colombians have had to live off a $80 monthly stipend, which may be miserable, but Mendoza spends three times as much on just one lunch.Being Colombian becomes even better when Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo comes over and the two consume an entire family’s income in just one hour.Admittedly, Trujillo was having a bad day that day as he just failed to convince the UN high commissioner of Human Rights that 9 million conflict victims doesn’t mean Colombia suffered an armed conflict.There’s always two sides to every story. After the Red Cross reported a spike in landmine victims, Mendoza deducted a $400 clothes iron and $27,000 in new furniture.Landmines are horrible. The ambassador wrote to the Foreign Ministry that “there are still things missing” in her home and received another $18,000 for the finishing touch.Mendoza was exempt from paying VAT on her $125,000 BMW 740 by fraudulently registering her vehicle in the embassy’s name, partly with revenue of the 21% VAT on cars Colombians often complain about.The negativity doesn’t stop there. When in the middle of the coronavirus crisis a repatriation flight left for Colombia on April 1, 23 Colombians wrote to President Ivan Duque that the plane had left without them, blaming Mendoza’s embassy for not alerting them about the flight.The 23 Colombians may not have been able to go home, but the ambassador was able to stay in her $24,500 / month apartment in Geneva. No complaints there.Despite the ambassador filing no complaint or expressing any negativity, the Foreign Minister was forced to open an investigation into Mendoza’s spending behavior.Some investigative journalism website, Cuestion Publica, apparently found the receipts.Instead of highlighting the positive side of her draining her country’s treasury in times of crisis, the journalists asked the ambassador’s boss about Mendoza’s expenses just when her country’s economy entered one of the worst crashes in a century.The investigative journalism website wasn’t taken down this time even though the Foreign Ministry was forced to announce an investigation.Mendoza knows that every cloud has a silver lining and that the foreign minister’s entire career has been paid for with taxpayers money. He would be cashing in his monthly stipend otherwise.The ambassador will likely be able to ignore journalists’ negative bias and show the world how accommodating Colombia is for human rights violation apologists.

" The gradual reactivation of the economy has accelerated the spread of the coronavirus in Colombia, according to the country’s National Health Institute (INS).Since April 27, the number of confirmed active infections has gone from 4,101 to 9,288 on Thursday when the INS said it had surpassed 500 confirmed deaths caused by Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.The real number of infections and deaths is believed to be multiple times that of the confirmed cases as the country is among the countries that have carried out the least number of tests per million inhabitants.The accelerating growth in the number of cases is causing growing tensions between the national government, local governments and health workers, who have said they are not given personal protection equipment (PPE) that would allow them to responsibly treat patients.An outbreak is causing a major crisis in Leticia, the capital of the southeastern Amazonas province, which is dealing with 821 active cases while its two public hospitals are in virtual ruins due to rampant corruption and state neglect.The situation is also becoming increasingly critical in Pacific port cities Tumaco and Buenaventura where healthcare is also scarce.The health secretary of Caribbean port city of Cartagena, where one in 10 of Colombia’s Covid-19 deaths have been registered, told Spanish news agency EFE it would try to expand its number of intensive care units from 65 to 297 by September.Local governments in all aforementioned cities have said they are having problems enforcing a lockdown as widespread poverty is forcing people to look for income.The mayor of the capital Bogota, Claudia Lopez, announced extra strict stay at home measures in neighborhoods where the confirmed number of cases has been particularly high.The only city that has been able to lower the number of active coronavirus cases while gradually reactivating economic activity is Medellin, partially by using the rare reagents to declare infected patients healthy in the shortest period of time.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz told Congress on Wednesday he expected infections to peak in mid June.The minister, who has received fierce criticism from healthcare organizations, did not say how he planned to curb the exponential growth. coronavirusnewsletterPublic health ",https://colombiareports.com/coronavirus-infections-in-colombia-growing-exponentially-since-reactivating-economy/,Colombia’s economic reactivation accelerated coronavirus infections

" Colombia’s former President Alvaro Uribe is finally getting his own “narconovela,” courtesy of the journalist who got the Supreme Court to investigate his alleged rigging of the 2018 elections.More than 35 years after the first evidence emerged of Uribe’s ties to the Medellin Cartel, “Matarife” promises to “morally do away with” the controversial political patron of President Ivan Duque.The narconovela is produced by Daniel Mendoza, the editor of news website La Nueva Prensa and one of the fiercest critics of the political pretenses of the former Medellin Cartel associate and alleged paramilitary chief.The first episode about Uribe’s perpetual run-ins with justice hast’s even aired, but Mendoza has already been flooded by death threats by far-right group “Aguilas Negras” and other so-called “Uribistas.”Mendoza, like almost all journalists in Colombia, has gotten used to the harassment that follows any criticism of the only Medellin Cartel associate in history who received both a honorary journalism degree from a former stripper and a Medal of Freedom from a US president.In an interview with Tercer Canal, the journalist and criminal lawyer said the series will be based mainly on the body of work of senior journalist Gonzalo Guillen, who has been in journalism since before Uribe and Pablo Escobar entered politics.The series is titled “Matarife,” which means “slaughterer” or “buffoon,” because that nickname particularly annoys the former president.Uribe initially sued the two journalists for allegedly tarnishing his good name by using that term, but gave up when he found out they planned to put his Medellin Cartel ties on court record.Mendoza’s expressed intention to “morally do away with” the former Medellin associate should get the former president who already is in court somewhat nervous.When his bulldog lawyer, Jaime Lombana, tried to pull a stunt on Guillen, the journalist publicly exposed the attorney as a narcissist drunkard who is investigated for money laundering and accused of assault by multiple women.

" Almost half of Colombia’s senators signed off on a proposal to urgently implement a guaranteed minimum income for more than 70% of the population.The radical proposal would temporarily guarantee 31 million people a monthly income of $225 (COP877,000), which is equal to the current minimum wage.This proposal guarantees the population the dignified survival and support of the labor force during the emergency, threatened by unemployment, loss of income and the destruction of businesses.SenatorsThe cost of the proposed minimum income would be approximately $10.4 billion (COP40.5 trillion), which is 4% of the country’s gross domestic product.This money would have to come from an increase in property tax, the cancellation of corporate tax discounts approved in December, a major restructuring of state government expenses and a loan from the central bank.“We are aware of the enormous cost of these measures, but they correspond to the enormous damage households and the economy has suffered, as well as the risk that this damage will increase and even be permanent,” the senators said.The proposal found the support of 50 of 103 senators, including members of President Ivan Duque’s coalition, as the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic is causing famine.According to economic think tank Fedesarollo, approximately 1.5 million Colombians lost their jobs since March 25 when the government all but shut down economic activity.While huge, the proposed bailout of the labor force is less than the $12.8 billion (COP50 trillion) the government pumped into the country’s financial system to prevent the collapse of banks.Additionally, the government sent stipends of approximately $80 to some 3 million families believed to have lost their income and vowed to subsidize the payment of 40% of minimum wage to workers of small and medium sized businesses.The government response so far has prevented the collapse of the country’s healthcare and financial systems, but couldn’t prevent the bankruptcy of an unknown number of businesses and a huge income reduction for almost the entire labor force.The senators’ radical proposal seeks not just to guarantee a minimum income for the labor force, but further lift the financial burden off businesses that are left without income.The government is trying to gradually reactivate the economy, but this is met with resistance from governors and mayors who fear the consequences of a collapse of their regions’ healthcare.The government did not immediately respond to the proposal. coronaviruseconomic crisisguaranteed minimum incomeminimum wagenewsletter ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-considering-guaranteed-minimum-income-as-famine-looms/,Colombia considering guaranteed minimum income as famine looms

" While Colombia’s health minister was in the southeastern town of Leticia faking aid, locals were building the first repository for the town’s growing number of COVID-19 deaths.The capital of the Amazonas province has always been spared much of the violence of Colombia’s armed conflict.But the border town could not escape the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic that in two weeks killed more people than violence has in the past four years.The fatal consequences of corruption and neglectAt least 27 people died of COVID-19 in the town of 50,000 since April 23 because chronic state neglect and the alleged corruption of Governor Jesus Galindo left Leticia without healthcare.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz has gone to great lengths to conceal the fatal consequences of his inaction and the corruption allegations against Governor Jesus Galindo, President Ivan Duque’s ally.Local journalist Antonio Paco Lasso has been unable to report on the reality in his town, because he became Colombian journalism’s first fatal victim of the pandemic on Thursday.Coronavirus in AmazonasThe corruption that left Leticia at the mercy of a virusHealth Minister Fernando Ruiz visited the town on Sunday to “analyze Plan Amazonas, surrender protection equipment and talk to the authorities and population,” according to the Health Ministry.The governor called for help last week, claiming that “up to this moment we do not have these resources here and we do not know how they should be managed” to combat the virus that has gone out of control.Colombia’s southeast in crisis as coronavirus breaks out and promised medical aid is missingAmazonas comptroller Daniel Oliveira told RCN Radio that Duque’s ally received $1.7 million (COP5 billion) to combat the coronavirus, but had gone on an embezzlement binge with the director of the local hospital, Jaime Riascos.The hospital director was suspended last week after allegedly purchasing medicine that never arrived from ghost companies or was about to expire, and reporting bogus maintenance contracts.The corruption and the robbery of hospital equipment left the hospitals in Leticia and Puerto Nariño in ruins and with a debt of more than $3.8 million (COP15 billion), according to Oliveira.The ruins of the San Rafael hospital in Leticia(Image: Luis Carlos Velez)(Image: Amazonas comptroller’s office)(Image: Luis Carlos Velez)The ruins of Puerto Nariño’s hospital(Image: Amazonas comptroller’s office)(Image: Amazonas comptroller’s office)📢#SOSAmazonas El Hospital de Puerto Nariño, en el Amazonas parece un lugar abandonado, un sitio fantasma.La corrupción de contratistas y políticos tienen en crisis al sistema de salud del Amazonas.Más las precarias condiciones laborales del poco personal de la salud que hay⚠️ pic.twitter.com/ayDFokPgeF— JUANCA (@JUANCAELBROKY) May 8, 2020How the minister is whitewashing carnageThe health minister used the abandoned hospital as the location for a propaganda video starring a whole team of people wearing personal protection equipment that almost 90% of Colombia’s hospital workers were never given, according to the Colombian Medical Federation.According to weekly Semana, 26 health workers were flown in a week ago to replace the hospital’s staff that collectively resigned in protest last month.The recruitment of four doctors and three chief nurses has already taken place, as well as the delivery of three ventilators. In addition, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection sent 5,000 swabs with the transport. They sent 90 conventional overalls, 200 Tibet overalls, 280 gowns, 1 infrared thermometer, 125 liters of antibacterial gel, 120 protective goggles, 5,000 pairs of nitrile gloves, 150 surgical masks, a gallon of 13% sodium hypochlorite and 255 N95 masks. Between May 4 and 8, 3,500 units of gel for villages in border areas, 3,500 mouth caps, and 3,500 gloves will be delivered to villages in border areas.

The former Millonarios player told soccer magazine AS that the Health Minister had come to Leticia just for show.“There is no aid here. If you get sick, you die and that’s the truth,” Mosquera said.We need them to send help, to do what they said, because they were here, but they did nothing. The hospital is the same. They just looked, but help as such did not arrive. They said it did, but the reality is different.Soccer player Luis MosqueraAccording to the former Millonarios player, the national government did not just fake sending medical aid, but also never sent economic aid that would allow the locals to stay at home.There’s a lot of worry and fear. The people here are very poor and have to go out to work and that’s also the problem, because no matter what, they have to eat and live from the day-to-day. Leticia is a very small town and we have contact with practically everyone, because we have to go to the same port, the same hospital, and the same town hall or governor’s office. Everyone is in contact and that’s why the chain is going to go up a lot.Soccer player Luis MosqueraSocial distancing for the deadArchitect’s impression of Leticia’s first coronavirus victims’ repository.While the health minister was doing his latest show, Leticia’s city hall announced that it had begun the construction of a building in which “52 tombs will be built for those who died from the COVID-19 pandemic.”The repository comes with a special fence to prevent mourning friends and family members from being infected by their diseased loved ones, according to the architect’s design.The National Health Institute estimated 400 ventilators would be needed in Leticia to save lives; Ruiz allegedly brought only three.The minister also confirmed that “there is no intensive care unit” in Amazonas, which may soon also have no governor if the Supreme Court decides to throw Galindo in jail.The town will have a fenced resting place for their loved ones, maybe more than one.

" Eight health workers have died and 560 have been infected by the coronavirus in Colombia, the National Health Institute (INS) said Wednesday as medical organizations call for the urgent provision of personal protection equipment (PPE’s).The INS said that 470 of the health workers were infected at work where only 12% have access to adequate PPE, according to the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC).‘40% of Colombia’s health workers considering resignation’ as Duque’s plans backfire, againThe doctors and nurses make up 6.5% of the 6.414 active cases of coronavirus in the country, the INS said.According to an FMC poll that was released earlier this week, 40% of health workers have considered resigning out of fear of infection or infecting others over the lack of PPE’s.If we have not been able to ensure the biosafety of frontline health care workers for Covid19 , how are we going to do it with 7.5 million manufacturing and construction workers?FMC vice-president Carolina CorchoThe health ministry said on April 15 it had sent all the funds to buy the necessary PPE’s to regional governments and health intermediaries.The FMC poll held among more than 900 health workers showed that almost half of the doctors and nurses felt forced to buy their own PPE’s in order to be able to work safely.The failure to protect Colombia’s healthcare personnel may be particularly critical, but the situation is not unique, according to the International Council of Nurses (ICN).Coronavirus infections among health workersSource: INS / ICNThe international organization said Thursday that worldwide at least 90,000 healthcare workers have been infected and at least 260 have died, according to Turkish press agency Anadolu.“Nurses and healthcare workers have been put at greater risk because of the lack of personal protective equipment and poor preparedness for this pandemic.” ICN chief executive officer Howard Catton said.The lack of PPE’s is not only a risk for the health workers, but poses a threat to Colombia’s healthcare system, whose capacity to treat coronavirus patients could be severely limited if doctors and nurses fall ill or die. coronavirushealthcarehealthcare crisis ",https://colombiareports.com/at-least-8-health-workers-killed-560-infected-by-coronavirus-in-colombia/,"At least 8 health workers killed, 560 infected by coronavirus in Colombia"
" Parents said Thursday that Colombia’s hospitals have been refusing treatment to children with cancer following a “hospital expansion” order that seeks to create capacity to deal with coronavirus infections.The April 2 order by Health Minister Fernando Ruiz sought no hospital expansion, but the cancellation of other treatments to free up beds as the government is trying to reactivate the economy.According to a number of organizations representing parents of children with cancer, the apparent priority to free up beds is endangering the lives and health of their children who require regular treatment.According to a poll held by the organizations, hospitals have suspended the treatment of the children of 59% of the 240 polled parents. Of the children who do still receive treatment, 8% said this has been irregular.It is a very difficult time, because in the midst of the crisis we find that the integral attention that Law 1388 requires for children with cancer has taken a back seat.Laura BonillaAmong low-income families, parents additionally expressed concerns that stipends to survive the lockdown that seeks to buy time to bolster the healthcare system are not enough to properly feed their children.We have encountered a number of impressive situations, families who literally have nothing to eat in their homes, because they live from their daily-pay work.Laura BonillaThe parents are concerned that the their children’s chances of receiving treatment as lockdown measures are relaxed and hospital beds fill up with COVID-19 patients will continue to be slim.The health minister’s idea to stop the treatment of other patients instead of effectively bolstering the healthcare system previously led to criticism that warned the “hospital expansion” order was pushing the hospitals closer to bankruptcy.Government failures push Colombia’s hospitals even closer to bankruptcyPresident Ivan Duque has used the availability of hospital beds as an argument to justify reactivating parts of the economy.Medical organizations have resisted this, claiming they haven’t been provided with the necessary personal protection equipment that would allow them to responsibly treat COVID-19 patients.Epidemiologists have accused the government of using insufficient or inaccurate data to justify reactivating the economy while effectively increasing the risk of collapsing the country’s healthcare system for which the consequences would be impossible to oversee. coronavirushealthcarehealthcare crisisnewsletterquarantine ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-coronavirus-response-refusing-treatment-to-children-with-cancer/,Colombia’s coronavirus response: refusing treatment to children with cancer
" Colombia’s government said Saturday that it has begun distributing 500,000 coronavirus tests in Bogota and to 20 of its 32 departments to improve the reliability of its contagion statistics.The announcement was made by Luis Guillermo Plata, the country’s COVID-19 response chief, who said that the tests will be distributed in line with the number of provinces’ inhabitants.Medical experts criticized the government of President Ivan Duque last week for announcing a second push to reactivate the country’s economy without having reliable data to responsibly make such a decision.Colombia plans to lift lockdown in coronavirus-free regionsThe National Health Institute (INS) has greatly expanded its testing capacity by adding regional laboratories to its network, but lacked the reagents to let the labs work at full capacity.Like almost all countries in Latin America, this has led to unreliable infection statistics that, according to experts, may represent less than five to 10 times the real number of infections.The network of labs will now be able to go from “two, three thousand daily tests to a capacity between 12 and 15 thousand tests a day,” said Plata.This will allow the national and local governments to “take decisions in real time,” according to the crisis response coordinator.Colombia’s healthcare show: ‘If you get sick, you die and that’s the truth’On Monday, the government wants to allow regions where no coronavirus has been confirmed to be able to request an exemption to an ongoing lockdown.At the same time, the government will relax restrictions on certain economic sectors also in areas where the virus is confirmed to be spreading.In all cases, mayors and governors will decide in which speed to do this as they are in charge of their region’s healthcare systems that were already on the brink of collapse before the pandemic.At least 8 health workers killed, 560 infected by coronavirus in ColombiaWhile the government has been pushing the reactivation of the economy, the local government and the medical sector have been slowing this down to buy more time to, for example, provide healthcare workers with personal protection equipments.While having one of the largest populations in South America, Colombia has registered considerably less infections than, for example, its neighbors Peru and Ecuador.According to the INS, 10,500 people were infected since March 6 and 445 people have died. Ecuador’s health authorities confirmed three times as many infections and deaths on Sunday.Health authorities of Peru, whose population is 60% that of Colombia, reported 65,000 and more than 1,800 deaths. coronavirushealthcarePublic health ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-claims-stepping-up-coronavirus-testing-ahead-of-economic-reactivation/,Colombia claims stepping up coronavirus testing ahead of economic reactivation

" Colombia’s Inspector General said his office had carried out a raid at the country’s army command on Wednesday as part of an investigation into reported illegal spying practices.Inspector General Fernando Carrillo told Congress he had ordered the raid as he, the prosecution and the Supreme Court are investigating the latest spying scandal in which American equipment reportedly was used to, among others, spy on American journalists.We collected evidence from the Army command and received statements from two generals. That is to say, we are moving forward with firm steps in that direction, as you all claim, the country needs to know the truth.Inspector General Fernando CarrilloThe opposition grilled Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo during the debate over his response, or lack thereof, to the army’s alleged spying on journalists, politicians and government officials in 2019 when retired General Nicacio Martinez was in command.Trujillo knew about the alleged spying practices after weekly Semana reported on them first in January, but didn’t take action until the magazine last week reported the army had even been “profiling” the former chief of staff of President Ivan Duque.Let it be clear that the government is at the service of the control agencies so that the whole truth is known, because according to Semana magazine, these alleged illegal actions had reached the office of the President of the Republic. There is no one more interested than the government in knowing the whole truth and in finding out who had an interest in plotting against the head of state.Defense Minister Carlos Holmes TrujilloThe virtual debate triggered clashes with the far-right Democratic Center party of President Ivan Duque after opposition Senators Ivan Cepeda (Democratic Pole) pointed out that, some of this classified information was reportedly sent to the ruling party.Cepeda, Senator Roy Barreras (U Party) and Senator Antonio Sanguino (Green Alliance), asked international organizations to intervene, according to the Democratic Pole senator.We are informing the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations today of these events that repeat serious episodes from the past, and we are requesting a special commission from both bodies to be present in the country and to carry out investigations.Senator Ivan CepedaCepeda and Barreras had already sought help in Washington DC after the initial reports on the army’s alleged criminal activity, both with the US Congress and Human Rights Watch.The latest spying scandal resembles that of the DAS wiretapping scandal that was exposed in 2009 when the political patron of President Ivan Duque, former President Alvaro Uribe, was in office.This scandal ultimately led to the incarceration of Uribe’s spy chief and two of his presidential aides. army wiretapping scandalmilitarynewsletterwiretapping ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-raids-army-command-as-illegal-spying-scandal-mushrooms/,Colombia raids army command as illegal spying scandal mushrooms
" President Ivan Duque plans to lift restrictions on almost one third of Colombia while 40% of the country’s doctors and nurses are considering  resigning.The president on Tuesday announced he sought to relax restrictions on more sectors of the economy to the despair of the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC) and other experts.According to Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez, the relaxations of the lockdown that would take force on May 12 would apply to 15 million people, almost a third of Colombia’s population.Colombia plans to lift lockdown in coronavirus-free regionsDuque driving medical personnel driven to despairFMC vice-president Carolina Corcho stressed that Duque couldn’t possibly protect these people as the vast majority of healthcare workers don’t even have personal protection equipment.According to the FMC, a poll among medical personnel revealed that 80% of the insurance companies who were ordered to provide personal protection equipment to hospital workers by Health Minister Fernando Ruiz never did so.“We have not been able to protect health personnel, how are we going to do this with other sectors? Corcho told Caracol Noticias.The same poll revealed that 40% of hospital workers are considering quitting their job, afraid they will be infected or infect others, according to the FMC executive.Colombia’s health workers forced to buy their own personal protection equipment“Duque making claims based on bogus data”Medical investigator Camilo Prieto said Duque made a risky decision as he lacks reliable data that could credibly indicate the consequences of such a brash move.The government has just made a risky decision, I could not call it good or bad because the available information is not sufficient to do so. What is clear is that there are no data available that would allow us to say that there is an evident slowdown in the contagion curve.Medical investigator Camilo PrietoHealth Minister Fernando Ruiz, who the medical community refuses to talk to, said the decision was based on the lowering of the contagion rate from 2.4%, a rate disputed by the National Health Institute (INS), to 1.3%.These rates, however, are from before the government ordered the reopening of manufacturing and construction, and based on gross underreporting, according to Prieto.Colombia has done 2,523 per million inhabitants, this is nothing compared to Chile’s 24,600 and Uruguay’s 12,463, reported La Silla Vacia.There is no data to claim that there is an evident slowdown in contagion.Medical investigator Camilo PrietoEspecially in the allegedly coronavirus-free regions where Duque wants to lift almost all restrictions, local authorities don’t have the means to test for coronavirus let alone treat possible outbreaks.Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez dismissed the government’s plans, pointing out that Spain took the same measures three weeks ago, which is now causing a rebound in deaths.Lopez, who has taken a leading role in sinking most of the government’s plans to restart the economy, said Colombia should seek a “new normal.”“Rather than reopening, we need to redefine a new normality in the city, which by definition will no longer be an agglomeration, but a collective space/time that prioritizes public health and living habits,” said Lopez.The Bogota mayor and others have long sidelined the national government and are following their own timeline. economic crisisIvan Duquequarantine ",https://colombiareports.com/40-of-colombias-health-workers-considering-resignation-as-duques-plans-backfire-again/,"‘40% of Colombia’s health workers considering resignation’ as Duque’s plans backfire, again"
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque said Tuesday he would lift a lockdown in areas without coronavirus on May 12 while relaxing economic restrictions on certain shops.In a television address, the president stressed that lockdown measures would remain in place in areas where the virus has been confirmed until May 25.Duque also said he was considering an extra $20 (COP80,000) stipend for the poor and stressed the efforts he has made to strengthen the country’s fragile healthcare sector that is coming under increased pressure.The government’s  failure to guarantee food security is making the enforcement of the lockdown that kicked off on March 25 increasingly difficult.Increased testing capacity has allowed the National Health Institute (INS) to confirm 640 new infections and 20 deaths on Tuesday, by far the highest number since the first case was confirmed on March 6.Decentralization of lockdown measuresThe president said that governors and mayors in regions where there have been no cases of coronavirus could request the Health Ministry to be exempt from the lockdown and resume economic and social activity.To prevent the virus from spreading into these often remote regions, Duque said that he would maintain a ban on intermunicipal travel.Within these exempted regions only bars and restaurants would not be allowed to restart economic activity.Economic reactivationOn a national level, Duque further amplified the sectors that would be allowed to reopen.While initially only allowing the reactivation of construction and specific manufacturing activities, some wholesale commerce and shops would be allowed to restart too.In all cases, mayors and governors would have the last word as the national government has gradually been shifting power to mayors and governors.The president triggered a rebellion among local and regional authorities in March when he unconstitutionally tried to usurp their powers.Since then, Duque has gradually improved relations with local authorities by explicitly granting them the authority to regulate economic reactivation in their town or city. coronavirusIvan Duquenewsletterquarantine ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-plans-to-lift-lockdown-in-coronavirus-free-regions/,Colombia plans to lift lockdown in coronavirus-free regions
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque has reportedly been using funds meant for his country’s peace process for unrelated government propaganda.Radio station La FM reported on Monday that Du Brand was hired and paid with funds meant for “the financing of peace programs aimed at encouraging the return to civilian life of groups that have taken up arms.”The president’s propaganda chief, Hassan Nassar, renewed the contract last week, paying Du Brands $840 thousand (COP3.4 billion) to also take charge of “the definition and implementation of the strategy to improve the president’s image online.”The firm would reportedly report directly to Nassar who added improving Duque’s public image “taking into account the national situation and the social mobilization activities launched on 21 November 2019” when Colombia saw its largest anti-government protests in more than four decades.The government’s violent attempts to quell these protests sunk Duque’s approval rating to a record low and “the need arises to know society’s perception of the current state of public policy, the progress and achievements of the Government in order to identify the actions to be taken, with the aim of facilitating interaction between citizens and public administration and providing institutional tools for the National Conversation proposed by the Government.”This “National Conversation” was a government attempt to sideline the students, unions and ethnic minorities who spearheaded the protests and have been demanding concrete policy concessions.Nassar did not deny that the funds to improve Duque’s public image came from the country’s peace process, but clarified “they are not resources set aside for the health emergency” caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Newspaper El Espectador reported that Du Brands has been working with the president’s far-right Democratic Center party since 2016 when it contributed almost $90,000 (COP330 million) to the campaign against a peace deal with now-demobilized FARC guerrillas.Duque has been under increasing pressure about his management of the peace process and the protests that, among other things, demanded the implementation of the peace deal.

" Colombia’s former army chief will be called in for questioning over his alleged role in spying on journalists, NGOs, opposition politicians and even the president’s office, the chief prosecutor said Monday.Less than a year and a half after President Ivan Duque appointed him commander of the army, General Nicacio Martinez is now one of the prime suspects in the spying scandal.In a press conference, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa said he would add the evidence of the military’s illegal spying practices made public by weekly Semana on Friday to an investigation that began in January.Paranoid Colombia: even Duque’s former chief of staff target of military spyingThis investigation began after the same magazine reported that Martinez ordered army intelligence units to wiretap civilian targets, including the Supreme Court.Why Barbosa announced action against Martinez only now is confusing as the former army chief was not alleged to be part of the illegal spying practices reported on Friday.What did emerge from Semana’s latest investigation is that the army was allegedly not just spying on government critics and the press, but also profiling the former chief of staff of President Ivan Duque, one of Barbosa’s best friends.I must stress the fact that persons close to the President of the Republic were profiled, according to the information known in recent hours, which is a serious risk against the institutions, national security and the rule of law in Colombia. This will be investigated to the fullest extent.Prosecutor General Francisco BarbosaAccording to the chief prosecutor, he has yet to be receive the findings of a forensic investigation that followed a raid in December last year that was ordered by the Supreme Court.Colombia’s army spied on court, politicians and journalists: reportThis raid was carried out with the help of investigators of the Inspector General, not the prosecution, which is also facing accusations of illegal wiretapping.Notwithstanding, Barbosa said that “the Prosecutor General’s Office will not allow that, using state institutions, the human rights or the freedom of expression of any Colombian is violated.”The prosecution’s sudden response comes amid fears that the army’s use of US spying equipment to spy on, among others, American journalists, endangers financial support from the US. army wiretapping scandalFrancisco BarbosamilitaryNicacio MartinezProsecutor General's Officewiretapping ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-to-call-former-army-chief-in-for-questioning-over-illegal-spying/,Colombia to call former army chief in for questioning over illegal spying
" Colombia’s President Ivan Duque issued a second state of emergency on Wednesday and announced subsidies for small businesses to continue paying wages during an ongoing shutdown.The second state of emergency since March 17 seeks to help small and medium-sized businesses pay wages, and prevent mass layoffs and bankruptcies.The decree also gave small and medium-sized businesses until the end of the year to pay their taxes.Specifically, the government will pay the companies $90 (COP350,000), which is 40% of the country’s minimum wage, to help them continue paying their personnel’s salaries.The companies can claim the subsidies for a period of three months beginning next week on the condition they don’t fire any of their employees, said Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla.We don’t have enough money to finance all of it, but we have a very significant percentage of the payroll for the next three months. We have this at hand. To make disbursements, and to implement the decision, it would be necessary to do this through an auditor or accountant of the companies.Finance Minister Alberto CarrasquillaSmall and medium-sized business association ACOPI celebrated the decision to grant subsidies instead of credit that the business association said was not a viable option for many of the companies.We are grateful for the response to the proposals presented by ACOPI, and we applaud this new measure to preserve national employment.ACOPI president Rosmery QuinteroColombia’s businesses demand subsidies, not loans to prevent mass layoffs and bankruptciesThe rescue plan for the small and medium-sized businesses would cost approximately $1.5 billion (COP 6 billion).While a major relief for the business community and workers, the government is unable to prevent major job losses, especially among those informally employed.According to economic think tank Fedesarollo, the lockdown that was put in place to prevent a rapid spread of the coronavirus on March 25 has already cost at least 1.4 million Colombians their jobs.

" The International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to extend a $10.8 billion flexible credit line (FCL) to Colombia’s central bank to bolster its reserves while coping with the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.The IMF’s loan is slightly less than the $11 billion requested by Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla last month.Colombia seeking $11B loan with IMF as coronavirus destroys budgetIn a press release, the IMF said that “Colombia qualifies for the FCL by virtue of its very strong institutional policy frameworks and track record of economic performance and policy implementation.”The arrangement should boost market confidence, and combined with the comfortable level of international reserves, provide insurance against downside risks.International Monetary FundAccording to the IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director Geoffrey Okamoto, Colombia’s relatively strong performance compared to the region ahead of the crisis “served as a basis for the economy’s resilience prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.”“In the wake of the pandemic, Colombia’s economy is expected to contract for the first time in two decades. Consistent with their very strong track record of economic management, the authorities’ early actions to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, monetary and macroprudential policy responses, and fiscal plans—including the creation of a crisis mitigation fund to support health spending, vulnerable households and businesses—will help the economy through recession,” said Okamoto.The IMF executive warn, however, that “the balance of risks to the economy is sharply skewed to the downside and an exceptionally weak external environment raises Colombia’s vulnerability to still lower commodity prices, additional financial market volatility, and a further deterioration of Venezuela’s crisis.”The new arrangement under the FCL will help Colombia manage heightened external risks, protect ongoing efforts to effectively respond to the pandemic, integrate migrants, foster inclusive growth, and reduce external vulnerabilities. Despite higher external vulnerabilities, risks, and stress, the new arrangement can be maintained at the same access level because the authorities have built higher external buffers by accumulating significant additional reserves since the 2018 FCL request. The arrangement should boost market confidence, and combined with the comfortable level of international reserves, provide insurance against downside risks.IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director Geoffrey OkamotoAccording to the IMF’s preliminary projection, Colombia’s GDP will contract 2,4% this year, considerably more than projected by Carrasquilla, who lowered the growth projection from 3.7% to between -1.5% and 2%.According to local economic think tank Fedesarollo, the extension of the crisis, and particularly the lockdown that is currently in place, could in the worst case scenario result in a 7.9% drop, which would be the biggest in history. coronaviruseconomic crisisIMF ",https://colombiareports.com/imf-agrees-to-lend-colombia-10-8b-to-combat-coronavirus-crisis/,IMF agrees to lend Colombia $10.8B to combat coronavirus crisis
" Colombia’s military used US resources to spy on American journalists, local NGO’s and politicians, and even President Ivan Duque’s former chief of staff, according to weekly Semana.Weekly Semana on Friday revealed evidence that among the 130 targets of the illegal spying operations were journalists of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, leading opposition senators, military commanders and even Jorge Mario Eastman, who resigned as Duque’s chief of staff last year.The information about the illegal spying practices was sent to Duque’s far-right Democratic Center (CD) party, Semana had already revealed in January.Colombia’s army spied on court, politicians and journalists: report“This is going to be a mess”Excerpt of the file in NYT’s former correspondent. (Image: Semana)While the illegal spying practices were already known, the extent of the military’s criminal activity in alleged collusion with the ruling party was not.According to Semana, the US embassy had already removed spying equipment provided to the military after its initial revelations, before knowing the Colombian military was using American tax payer’s money to spy on American journalists.In the case of the New York Times’ former correspondent, Nicolas Casey, the military created an entire folder in which they tried to map the reporters’ contacts. Casey’s file included even an American former intern of Colombia Reports.The Americans are not going to like that part of their own money, of their taxpayers as they say, has been diverted from the legitimate purposes for which it was given, the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking, ended up being used to dig into the lives of journalists of important media from their own country.

" Illegal wiretapping and spying has long been common in Colombia, but the reported intelligence gathering on President Ivan Duque’s former chief of staff has pushed paranoia to a whole new level.Journalists, opposition politicians and non-government organizations have long assumed they were somehow monitored either by Military Intelligence, the National Intelligence Directorate (DNI), the Prosecutor General’s Office or the DIJIN, the intelligence unit of the National Police.By last year, it had already become clear that even outsiders had access to the wiretapping facilities of the military and the prosecution, which was engaged in corporate spying.Colombia’s former chief prosecutor ordered wiretapping peace talks: reportWeekly Semana had already reported in January that a covert unit within the military was intercepting communication of at least one Supreme Court magistrate, congressmen and journalists.Semana’s latest findings were that the unit had at least 130 “profiles” and “special operations” files, including military officials, and government officials as high as Jorge Mario Eastman, until May last year the president’s right-hand man, and was thus gathering intelligence inside the presidential palace.While apparently containing no wiretap information, the Eastman file did contain confidential information like contacts within the military and the DNI.The same magazine found out in January that some of the intelligence obtained through wiretapping was shared with the Democratic Center, the political party of Duque’s political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe.Colombia’s army spied on court, politicians and journalists: reportThe Eastman file, however, would be of little interest to Uribe and his associates; many of them would have their long-time ally’s phone number.The files on Eastman and other military and government officials rather indicate a counterintelligence operation gone paranoid schizophrenic as Semana was unable to indicate who ordered these operations or why.What the weekly did find out was that the wiretapping unit of the Center of Military Intelligence and Counterintelligence in Bogota, which was also used by the CIA, surprisingly closed five months ago, around the time the Supreme Court ordered raids.Equally surprising, Semana reported that some 300 people continued to work in the office building of the DAS, the intelligence agency that was dismantled in 2011 and replaced by the DNI.The corporate spying at the prosecution had already made clear there was something seriously wrong with the checks and balances on Colombia’s wiretapping facilities.The closing of Military Intelligence’s “Grey Room” indicates something seriously had gone wrong there too.The appearance of intelligence files on the president’s former chief of staff, and other supposedly trusted government and military officials indicates nothing but utter chaos in which nobody knows who is spying on who. army wiretapping scandalmilitarywiretapping ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-latest-spying-scandal-reveals-mainly-that-nobody-knows-who-is-spying-who-and-why/,Colombia’s latest spying scandal reveals mainly that nobody knows who is spying on who and why
" The people of Bojaya on Saturday commemorated the 2002 massacre in their northwest Colombia village for the first time in the presence of those they lost, but without the peace they were promised.It took 18 years for the locals to honor most of the more than 80 people who died in the massacre after the identification and return of their remains as part of the country’s peace process last year.The same peace process left the town without the FARC, whose home made mortar crashed through the roof of the local church where the community was hiding from combat between the guerrillas and paramilitaries.What the peace process never brought was peace.The same state abandonment that put the town in the crossfire of the AUC and the FARC in 2002 is now putting it in the crossfire of ELN guerrillas and the AGC paramilitaries.President Ivan Duque even forgot the date of the guerrillas’ worst massacre. His Sunday morning claim that “today we reiterate our commitment with the victims” couldn’t possibly sound emptier.The FARC did remember the date, saying Saturday on Twitter that “there are no words for the caused pain.”Community leader Leyner Palacios, who arguably fought hardest to have the remains of the 27 family members he lost identified and returned to his village, was unable to be in Bojaya.Palacios was forced to flee to the capital earlier this year after the paramilitaries made it clear he would be dead within 24 hours if he showed his face.The lights of hope are fading in Colombia. There used to be a lot of lights, full of hope, but every day there are less and less. There are very few lights left now.Leyner PalaciosFrom the capital, the community leader commemorated his lost loved ones by watching the documentary “Bojaya, in the Crossfire” on TV.The people in Bojaya weren’t able to watch the documentary.

" President Ivan Duque is planning a second push to restart Colombia’s economy, this time allowing the reactivation of normal economic activity in regions where the virus hasn’t spread.A first attempt to restart the economy  by opening the construction and manufacturing sectors was largely blocked by mayors and governors who imposed measures slowing this down.Duque said Saturday that he would now seek regional divisions in coordination with mayors and governors in areas where the virus hasn’t spread to resume economic activity.Low-risk reactivation?After the urban resistance against reopening the economy while the country’s hospitals are still preparing for a post-quarantine outbreak, Duque and his Interior Minister Alicia Arango were considerably more careful coining their second attempt to restart economic activity.Arango told newspaper El Tiempo on Sunday that the government was thinking about provinces in the Amazon regions and the eastern plains where no infections at all have been confirmed.Putumayo Governor Buanerges Rosero said he would consider the idea under the condition that the borders of the southern province remain closed to prevent contagion from other parts of the country.Other governors didn’t immediately respond to the ideas of Duque and Arango amid concerns about the fragility of healthcare in these regions may the virus arrive.More than six weeks after declaring a national emergency, many hospitals are still short of personal protection equipment and ventilators that would allow them to respond to s surge in infections.In all cases, Arango said, the local authorities would have the last word, taking into consideration their healthcare capacities.The first responders in health in the territory are the governors and mayors. They are the ones who make the policies and protocols issued by the Government through the Ministry of Health operational.Interior Minister Alicia ArangoCoronavirus dramatically decentralized governmentThe president’s decentralized version of an “intelligent lockdown” is a world apart from his initial strategy that sought a major centralization of power.Duque unconstitutionally tried to usurp local governments’powers and revoke lower government’s measures to slow down the spread of the virus, triggering a rebellion among mayors and governors.The government’s plan for a regional approach to the intelligent lockdown would give mayors and governors even more power to demand health resources hospitals say they never received.This failure to quickly bolster the country’s healthcare system, which was already on the brink of collapse before the pandemic, is the main obstacle to end a lockdown and restart the economy, both on a national and regional level.Duque initially decreed a lockdown between March 25 and April 27. This was later extended to May 11, but included attempts to restart manufacturing and construction.The president said Friday he has yet to take a decision  on whether to extend or end the lockdown on May 11. Much of this will have to do with the government’s ability to prepare the hospitals and prevent a collapse of the healthcare system. coronaviruseconomic crisis ",https://colombiareports.com/restarting-colombias-economy-take-2-regional-reactivation/,Restarting Colombia’s economy take 2: regional reactivation

" Instead of bolstering Colombia’s healthcare system in order to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, hospitals claim the government of President Ivan Duque is pushing them even closer to bankruptcy.According to hospital association ACHC, the government did not just fail to cancel outstanding debts as promised in March, but ordered them to clear beds, which has deprived them of income.The hospitals’ cry for help comes weeks after the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC) said it had lost confidence in Health Minister Fernando Ruiz who took office in January.Ruiz’s “hospital expansion plan”The hospitals’ rapidly growing financial woes are the consequence of the “hospital expansion plan” announced by Ruiz on April 2 in anticipation of a surge of coronavirus patients needing medical care.In true Duque fashion, this plan sought no hospital expansion at all, but ordered hospitals to cancel treatments and free up existing capacity to prevent hospitals from exceeding their maximum capacity.The lockdown that took force on March 25 prevented this surge, leaving hospitals on average half empty.Nevertheless, the canceling of surgeries left operating rooms in the capital working at 70% while usually they are full.Colombia’s hospital capacitySource: Colombian Hospital AssociationThe financial pain and the financial gainThe problem is that the minister forgot that the public hospitals aren’t paid by the state, but by private health intermediaries who charge Colombians monthly, but pay hospitals for rendered services, if they pay at all.Consequently, these intermediaries have been filling their coffers with compulsory healthcare payments while the hospitals have been going broke.Thanks to Ruiz’s “expansion plan,” high-level hospitals in the capital Bogota alone have seen their income drop from $5 million to $3 million over the past month, according to weekly Semana.The majority of surgeons, who are not on staff but get paid per surgery, lost 90% of their income, the weekly was told.The minister may need an ear operationThe ACHC sent out an alert last week, about the government’s failure to cancel debts as promised, as well as the hospitals’ forcibly lost income, but without a response.The FMC and the opposition have urged Duque to assume control over the healthcare system, but also without a response.In the meantime, hospitals are considering firing personnel while they were supposed to be increasing their capacity to confront the coronavirus pandemic.“If we do not receive government support, we will have to fire some of the staff who have a steady monthly contract,” said Daniel Parra of the Santa Sofia clinic in Buenaventura, the Pacific port city’s only high-level hospital.While the government is trying to gradually restart the economy and claiming to be bolstering the country’s already fragile healthcare system, the hospitals claim they are racing towards default. coronavirushealthcarehealthcare crisis ",https://colombiareports.com/government-failures-push-colombias-hospitals-even-closer-to-bankruptcy/,Government failures push Colombia’s hospitals even closer to bankruptcy
" It took months of inaction, but Colombia’s government finally turned Villavicencio’s prison into the perfect coronavirus petri dish from where its prison chief infected at least three more prisons.The result of introducing the coronavirus to a prison with a 98% overcrowding rate, an average temperature of 78.5°F, a 65% humidity rate and a ration of three hours of water a day would impress many wanna-be death camp directors.Almost 300 of the 1,900 inmates, and at least 13 prison guards and cooks were confirmed to be infected with the virus on Tuesday. Four are dead.Even a 12-year-old boy was infected after hanging out near the wardens of the prison with more registered coronavirus infections than the country’s second largest city, Medellin.“We are grateful for the support and commitment of the national government for attending this emergency in the penitentiary,” Meta governor Juan Guillermo Zuluaga said Tuesday without a whiff of sarcasm.“You have to ask for the resignation of Ivan Duque who of all the presidents in the world was the one who permitted the arrival of COVID-19 in the prison system,” prison guard union leader Diana Salinas responded Wednesday.The prison guards have filed criminal charges against the director of prison authority INPEC who spread the virus to at least three other prisons by transferring infected prisoners from Villavicencio.Six months in office and Colombia’s prison chief already facing criminal chargesThe inmates are beyond terrified. “We’ve been condemned to death,” one told weekly Semana.Justice Minister Margarita Cabello preffered to look at the bright side of the carnage she was causing after ignoring warnings for months. “We’ve had a lot of negative cases, which is a good thing that must also be said,” she told W Radio.While some inmates have effectively been condemned to death, one third of Colombia’s prisoners hasn’t even been convicted. Some convicts have long served their time, but were simply never released.But also this had its advantages, according to Cabello. “They are helping us producing surgical material…they are helping us provide masks, which is something we are thankful for,” said the minister who, like many criminals, may be able to evade prison. coronavirusprison crsisisprisons ",https://colombiareports.com/how-to-turn-colombias-prisons-into-coronavirus-death-camps-and-stay-positive/,How to turn Colombia’s prisons into coronavirus death camps and stay positive

" Despite calls for an extension, Colombia’s ELN rebels end their unilateral ceasefire on Thursday, claiming that military offensives demonstrated President Ivan Duque is not interested in peace or in combating the coronavirus pandemic.It was unfortunate that the Duque government had not responded in a reciprocal manner or listened to the proposals we made to advance the search for peace. On the contrary, we saw a government interested in taking advantage of the unilateral cessation, maintaining joint operations with the paramilitaries, to gain greater territorial control and continued with its plan to assassinate social leaders.ELNThe decision was met with disappointment by civil society groups and United Nations’ Secretary General Antonio Guterres.The UN chief had called for an end to all armed conflict in March, claiming that “the fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war.”The ELN responded to the call by announcing its ceasefire, but Guterres was ignored by the Colombian military, which continued military offensives against the 55-year-old guerrilla group.The UN chief’s spokesperson said the month-long ceasefire “was having a positive effect” and “would have brought hope and a message of peace to communities affected by the conflict and more, facilitated the response to the pandemic.”Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos rejected the ELN’s decision to resume its attacks, claiming that the guerrillas “are doing nothing but distancing themselves from the reality of this country.”The government demands from the ELN a permanent ceasefire and the immediate handing over of all abductees, all minors who have been forcibly recruited, and an immediate halt to the installation of anti-personnel mines.Peace Commissioner Miguel CeballosThe ELN’s resumption of attacks further diminishes the government’s ability to respond to the pandemic, which was already struggling because of corruption and mismanagement.Prospects of peace talks had already been complicated after the guerrillas rejected to accept mediation by two former commanders appointed as “peace promoters” by the government.The end of the guerrillas’ ceasefire comes weeks before health authorities project the pandemic to really put the country’s fragile healthcare system to the test. armed conflictcoronavirusELNpeace talks ",https://colombiareports.com/eln-ends-coronavirus-ceasefire-weeks-ahead-of-expected-peak-in-infections/,ELN ends coronavirus ceasefire weeks ahead of expected peak in infections

" Colombia’s construction and manufacturing sectors restarted some activity on Monday amid fierce resistance from the opposition, which claimed this meant “sending workers to the slaugherhouse.”The plan of President Ivan Duque to restart these sectors is being slowed down by the mayors of all major cities who said they will allow only a gradual restart of construction and manufacturing.Cities in no rush to follow Duque’s leadBogota Mayor Mayor Claudia Lopez told newspaper El Espectador on Sunday that in the capital “no site will be reopened.”Instead, city authorities will first register companies who want to resume activity. Once their compliance with health protocols is verified, they will be authorized to restart commercial activity.Medellin, the country’s second largest city, had already started this registration and verification process last week, but ran into technical issues that could delay authorization.In Cali, no construction site or factory may open without obtaining a so-called “digital health passport” that companies were unable to request until Monday.The city halls of Bucaramanga and Cartagena have begun granting permissions to construction sites, but said factories would be opened gradually.Lockdown remains in place, but with permission for outdoor exerciseWith the exception of the businesses allowed to open by the mayors, the national lockdown will remain in place both for small businesses and citizens at least until May 11.The government did loosen the restrictions to allow citizens one hour of outdoor physical exercise all day and the participation in gambling and lottery activities.In an attempt to alleviate the situation for those suffering hunger, Duque said Saturday that he would transfer another $20 dollars to 3 million families who requested emergency aid as the lockdown left them without income.Meanwhile, the country’s medical sector continued to push the government to effectively bolster Colombia’s healthcare sector as promised to prevent a collapse in the event the gradual reactivation of the economy causes a surge in coronavirus infections. constructioncoronavirusmanufacturingquarantine ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-partially-reactivates-economic-activity-amid-fierce-resistance/,Colombia partially reactivates economic activity amid fierce resistance
" Colombia’s health ministry rolled back a forced labor order for doctors and nurses on Thursday after fierce protests by the country’s medical community.Health Minister Fernando Ruiz issued a decree in which he rolled back a controversial article from a previous decree that obliged medical personnel to work without security guarantees or pay.The new decree allows medical personnel to refuse to work if they believe the guarantees for them to do their work do not exist.The health minister rolled back the controversial article, but did not attend structural problems in healthcare before restarting the country’s manufacturing and construction sectors on Monday.The latest decree “does not solve the problem of labor security, back payments or the effective provision of biosecurity for Covid 19 care” that would provide these guarantees, said Carolina Corcho, the Vice-President of the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC) on Twitter.Seventy-two decrees have been issued by the National Government since the Covid19 declaration of emergency, and it has not been able to resolve urgent health problems.Colombian Medical Federation vice-president Carolina CorchoThe World Health Organization and Colombian medical organizations urged to prioritize preparing the health sector before restarting parts of the economy.Colombia’s medical sector withdrew its confidence in the health minister after all their recommendations were ignored, hospitals were forcibly shut because of coronavirus outbreaks and medical personnel began walking out.Like in almost the entire southern hemisphere, Colombia’s limited capacity to test for the virus makes it impossible to estimate what the human cost would be of reopening the economy.Tests per million inhabitantsThis maps excludes the data from Iceland, Faroe Islands, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Malta, Luxembourg, Gibraltar and San Marino whose exceptionally high testing rates made regional differences invisible)According to Corcho, the government’s plans to open manufacturing and construction alone would collapse the healthcare system in the capital Bogota in a single day.Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez, who has refused to do this, said earlier this week she believed the capital’s healthcare system would last a month.Meanwhile, hospitals have not seen a peso of the promised $1.5 billon financial injection promised by the national government last month, according to the FMC and coalition party Radical Change.In Colombia, local leaders in some capital cities and departments with financial capacity have made progress in adapting low-complexity field hospitals to free up high-complexity hospitals where intensive care units are located; however, the health system remains under the financial and contracting control of the [health intermediaries] EPS, which does not guarantee equity in access to services, and the possibility of a minimum principle of planning by the State.Colombian Medical Federation vice-president Carolina CorchoSeveral hospitals have already shut down either because personnel were quarantined or they massively walked out.With some health workers not having been paid in months and 80% of the hospitals lacking the most basic personal protection, there is no saying how many doctors and nurses will consider they have the guarantees to do their work and  confront the virus responsibly.

" Colombia’s chief prosecutor asked the Supreme Court to investigate the role of the country’s agriculture minister in the alleged misappropriation of emergency coronavirus funds.In a joint press conference with the inspector general and the comptroller general, chief prosecutor general Francisco Barbosa announced that Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Zea was among those suspected of corruption.In a press release, the three investigative bodies anounced the suspension of a governor, criminal investigations into six others and investigations into two national government agencies.Colombia suspends governor, investigates 6 more on coronavirus corruption claimsIt wasn’t until the press conference that it became clear that these agencies were the National Planning Department, which apparently transferred emergency funds to ghost accounts, and agricultural support agency Finagro, which allegedly granted emergency credit to large firms instead of farmers.Additionally, Barbosa said that there is one corruption suspect only the Supreme Court can investigate, “which is the minister of agriculture.”The alleged corruption in the allocation and spending of emergency funds had already caused major indignation, but on Friday dropped a bomb right in the middle of President Ivan Duque’s government.The investigation against the National Planning Department was never supposed to happen as Duque personally shielded government officials involved in alleged corruption from prosecution by decree.While the Constitutional Court is studying the legality of this decree, Barbosa decided to ignore it and proceed with opening an investigation into the program that was supposed to send emergency stipends to the country’s poor.Duque’s most damning scandal to date left 1.8 million Colombians starving: reportThe latest corruption investigation into the Duque administration adds to ongoing investigations into the president and his political patron, former President Alvaro Uribe, over their alleged role in a plot to rig the 2018 elections.The corruption has severely reduced the government’s capacity to respond to the pandemic while the president is increasingly struggling to maintain control and legitimacy. agricultureColombia Agro ProducecorruptionRodolfo Zea ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-agriculture-minister-to-be-investigated-over-coronavirus-funds-scandal/,Colombia’s agriculture minister to be investigated over coronavirus funds scandal
" Colombia’s Comptroller General’s Office blocked emergency credit payments meant for farmers, claiming that 90% of the funds went to major agricultural firms.The suspension made “Colombia Agro Produce” the second emergency aid program decreed by the government of President Ivan Duque to be put on hold due to fraud suspicions.A program to deliver emergency stipends to Colombia’s poorest inhabitants was also put on hold leaving 1,8 million of 3 million people starving, according to weekly Semana.Duque’s most damning scandal to date left 1.8 million Colombians starving: reportThe Colombia Agro Produce scandal put Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Zea in a tight spot as much as similar irregularities with the “Agro Ingreso Seguro” put his predecessor Andrés Felipe Arias in prison.In a warning issued last week, the Comptroller General’s Office said that $52.8 million (COP214 billion) of the $56 million (COP226 billion) in credit lines had gone to agro-industrial firms and traders and that only $2 million (COP8.3 billion) had gone to medium-sized agricultural firms and $1 million (COP4.2 billion) to small farmers.The government’s agricultural stimulation fund, Finagro, initially denied the claim of the Comptroller General’s Office, claiming that “Colombia Agro Produce extended 1,182 loans: 897 for small, 208 for medium and 77 for large producers.”Finagro said it was complying with the guideline that “no less than 40% of the total value of the resources allocated for the subsidy on interest of credit shall be allocated to small producers, and in no case may more than 20% of these resources be allocated to large producers.”But after Congress announced that it was also investigating Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Zea and Finagro president Airo Estrada, the latter said that “the beneficiaries had requested the suspension” of the aid program and would return the funds.The investigator in charge of the alleged misallocation of funds, Gabriel Romero Sundheim, responded that the Comptroller General’s Office’s would continue to investigate “the implementation of controls prior to access to subsidy resources and subsequent controls to establish that the loans are used as intended.”The Comptroller General’s Office teamed up with the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Inspector General’s Office earlier this month to monitor possible corruption after the government announced major aid packages in response to the coronavirus crisis. agricultureColombia Agro Producecoronaviruscorruption ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-great-coronavirus-heist-part-3-the-farmers-credits/,Colombia’s great coronavirus heist: Part 3 | the farmers’ credits

" Colombia’s war crimes tribunal on Tuesday granted amnesty to three former IRA members who had been sentenced to prison for assisting the now-defunct FARC rebel group in bomb-making.Irishmen Martin John McCauley, Niall Terrence Connolly and Seamus O‘Muineachain received amnesty after the court ruled that — even though they weren’t members of the FARC — their crimes were directly related to the armed conflict.The former IRA members were arrested in 2001 and sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2004 on fraud charges. By then, they had already fled to Ireland, the Prosecutor General’s Office announced.“The Colombia Three” were granted parole on the condition they would carry out no activity in opposition to the state and would be made available to foreign authorities if requested.McCauley, Connolly and O‘Muineachain were arrested in 2001 after spending time with the FARC to teach the Colombian guerrillas bomb-making techniques they had learned during “The Troubles” in northern Ireland.According to Colombian authorities, the three had been seen in a demilitarized zone in southern Colombia where the FARC and the government of former President Andres Pastrana were holding peace talks at the time.The former IRA members were the last remaining foreigners with pending prison sentences for crimes related to Colombia’s armed conflict after a 2016 peace deal between the FARC and former President Juan Manuel Santos allowed the release of dozens of foreign members of the former guerrilla group. armed conflictIRAIrelandJEPpeace process ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-releases-former-ira-members-as-part-of-peace-process/,Colombia grants amnesty to former IRA members as part of peace process
" President Ivan Duque and the opposition fiercely criticized Colombia’s banks over their alleged lack of cooperation to help the country through the coronavirus pandemic.Both the central bank and the Duque administration pumped emergency funds into the financial system last month, totaling $120 billion according to the opposition.The president explicitly asked the banks for “solidarity” and made their stringent credit regulations more flexible to help the country’s small and medium-sized businesses through the crisis.Duque calls on banks’ ‘solidarity’ to help save Colombia’s economy“Vampires”Congress and Duque were said to be indignant after Conservative Party Senator David Barguil on Tuesday revealed that while the central bank slashed their interest rate, banks increased theirs by more than 6%.Seven of the major banks, who account for 55% of the market, raised their rates to an average of 139 base points above the rates that were in force in March. This is a proportional interest rate increase to 6.12%.Senator David Barguil“This is nothing but abuse,” said Barguil.The director of bankers’ association Asobancaria, Santiago Castro, denied the accusations the banks were taking advantage of the crisis.I want to dispel the myth that the banks have done nothing in this crisis. Not only did we have a goal of refinancing 80 trillion ($19 billion), but we are exceeding that goal by more than 60%. Refinancing 124 trillion ($30 billion) is refinancing more than a quarter of the portfolio, and we have done that with our own resources.Banking representative Santiago CastroDuque told radio station La FM he would ask the Superintendency for Finance to take action against the “vampires” in the financial system.Finance Superintendent Jorge Castaño told newspaper El Tiempo on Wednesday he saw no reason to do so.Finance minister facing third motion of no confidenceOpposition Senator Gustavo Petro urged congress to put its money where its mouth is and file a third motion of no confidence against Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla, who had negotiated the government’s financial injection into the financial system.If Congress wants to act, why is there no motion of no confidence against the finance minister? I would invite [coalition party] Radical Change to team up with us and the other political parties that disagree with that policy towards the banks, and we vote to see what happens.Senator Gustavo PetroAnything but forcing the controversial minister to resign is “nothing but rhetoric,” said Petro. bankscoronaviruseconomic crisis ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-banks-bashed-from-all-sides-over-vampire-response-to-coronavirus-crisis/,Colombia’s banks bashed from all sides over ‘vampire’ response to coronavirus crisis
" Think tank Fedesarollo on Wednesday projected that Colombia’s economy would contract between 2.7% and 7.9%, the worst slump in recorded history, this year.The think tank was even more pessimistic than Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla, who already had warned that 2020 was going to be the “worst year in Colombia’s economic history” as a consequence of the coronavirus and dropping oil prices.Finance minister expects ‘worst year in Colombia’s economic history’Carrasquilla said earlier this month he projected a drop between -1.5% and -2%, considerably more optimistic than Fedesarollo, whose worst case scenario is an unprecedented economic slump.The news is not good. This is due to the containment measures that were necessary to mitigate the expansion of COVID-19, as well as the fall in oil prices and the social distancing measures that we estimate will have to be maintained during the second half of this year.Fedesarollo director Luis Fernando MejiaGlobal oil prices dropped to a new low between the projections of Carrasquilla and Fedesarollo, which would stretch the country’s budget deficit even further.The economy is currently in its worst contraction in history, according to the think tank, which expected that the second quarter of this year would be the worst with a contraction of -9.4%.Fedesarollo additionally expected that, in the best case scenario, unemployment would go from 10.5% to 16.3%, meaning that at least 1.4 million Colombians are expected to lose their jobs. The think tanks worst case scenario is a 10 point increase in unemployment.Investor confidence in March plummeted to -35%, its lowest point in the 40-year history of the think tank.Colombia’s worst crisis registered since the early 1960’s was in 1999 after a housing bubble triggered the collapse of all but one of the public banks and the economy contracted 4.4%.Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez said earlier this week that she expected the global crisis to undo 20 years of poverty reduction while the United Nations said that the crisis created the risk of mass starvation among the Venezuelan migrant population. economic crisisGDPnewsletterunemployment ",https://colombiareports.com/think-tanks-fears-colombias-worst-economic-crash-in-history/,Think tank fears Colombia’s worst economic crash in history
" The mayor of Colombia’s capital Bogota said Tuesday she will not reopen the construction and manufacturing sectors next week as proposed by President Ivan Duque, but will do so gradually.Duque said Monday he would allow the reopening of the sectors that employ some 5 million people, adding on Tuesday that local and regional government would be responsible for monitoring compliance with biosecurity protocols.“Not possible”According to Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez, opening both sectors at once is “not possible” and that she would gradually authorize the reopening of factories.It is not possible to reactivate the construction and manufacture sectors in Bogota at the same time on Monday. The first generates 560,000 trips per day and the second 567,000 trips per day! Both of these would greatly increase the health risk for workers.Claudia Lopez“Following the national protocol,” Lopez said she will define the “specific condition and dates for each business” to open its doors in the capital.Before Duque’s announcement to allow the reopening of the manufacturing sector, Bogota’s mayor had already said she would first open bicycle repair shops to minimize pressure on the capital’s public transport system.Lopez suggested that other cities should follow her example in an ongoing power struggle between Colombia’s two most powerful public officials.Mayors and governors rebelled last month when Duque unconstitutionally tried to usurp their powers and revoke local and regional measures to slow down the spread of the coronavirus.Medical personnel are furious with the government, claiming that staff have yet to receive personal protection equipment that would allow them to treat a more widespread outbreak.Other cities ambiguous on how to proceedThe mayors of other major cities like Medellin and Cali did not immediately say  how they would proceed after initially expressing reservations about the government’s plans to restart the two sectors that generate most employment.Medellin Mayor Daniel Quintero initially applauded  Duque’s decision to extend the quarantine and warned  that between two and three million people could be infected by the coronavirus in his city’s metropolitan area.Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina maintained strict restrictions of movement in the country’s third largest city, allowing only a limited number of people to leave home to go to the bank, and buy food and pharmaceutical supplies.Neither immediately responded to the president’s more detailed explanation of the protocols for the manufacturing and construction sectors.All seem keen to prevent a rebellion like last month, but the mayors are more concerned about whether their regional health systems will hold when reopening the economy is expected to accelerate infections of the coronavirus pandemic.

" A month after promising to cancel $1.5 billion debts owed to public hospitals, Colombia’s President Ivan Duque has yet to transfer a single peso, the Inspector General’s Office said Wednesday.The watchdog urged Duque to fulfill his promise to cancel the debt that “has obviously affected the functioning of public hospitals and endangered their continuity.”Duque announced the emergency financial injection in March as part of a series of measures to prevent the collapse of the country’s health system and provide emergency food assistance to the country’s poor.Coronavirus: Colombia to inject $1.5B in healthcare and secure food for 10 million during quarantineThe Inspector General’s Office urged the government not just to keep its word, but also not to “give in to pressure” from notoriously corrupt private health intermediaries to send them the emergency funds.Instead the watchdog urged to “guarantee the continuous flow of resources to the hospitals, in order to ensure the payment of fees, salaries, benefits and social security contributions of their medical, paramedical and administrative staff, and comply with financial agreements with hospital medical providers.”Coalition party Radical Change told the president in a remarkably harsh press release to “stop making announcements and start governing,” repeating the Inspector General’s Office call to “URGENTLY” provide hospitals with the promised funds.Duque’s most damning scandal to date left 1.8 million Colombians starving: reportThe conservative party additionally urged the president to use the extraordinary powers his cabinet obtained after declaring a state of emergency to decree a reform of the country’s healthcare system that has been on the brink of collapse for more than a decade.We believe that the current situation of the coronavirus forces us to insist, once again, on the imperious need to convert our initiative to reform the Colombian health system into law.Radical ChangeDuque, who was already highly unpopular, has come under increasing pressure over his handling of the crisis caused by the coronavirus. coronavirushealthcareInspector General's OfficeIvan DuquenewsletterRadical Change ",https://colombiareports.com/a-month-after-promising-emergency-financial-injection-for-colombias-hospitals-duque-yet-to-transfer-a-peso/,"A month after promising emergency funds for Colombia’s hospitals, Duque yet to transfer a peso"
" The freedom of the press deteriorated in Colombia last year as journalists continued to suffer violence and abuse by illegal armed groups, public officials and even their own bosses, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF).Particularly reporting on “the environment, public order, armed conflicts, corruption or collusion between politicians and illegal armed groups elicits systematic harassment, intimidation and violence,” according to RSF.Consequently, Colombia saw its suppression rate go up slightly and its position in the press freedom index drop a spot to 130 of 180.Press freedom in the AmericasSource: Reporters Without BordersThreat 1: illegal armed groupsJournalists continued to be “permanently threatened” by paramilitary groups that have been associated with the military, drug traffickers, “legitimate” businesses and politicians alike.Additionally, “armed groups such as the ELN and FARC dissidents try to silence alternative and community media that cover their activities, leading to the creation of information “black holes,” especially in rural areas,” said the RSF.Colombia’s ‘Aguilas Negras’ declare journalists ‘military objective’Threat 2: media bosses“The media’s close links to Colombia’s business empires and political class undermines editorial independence and reinforces self-censorship,” according to the press freedom organization.The RSF has been monitoring media ownership in Colombia since 2015 and found in 2018 that three corporations, the Ardilla Lulle Group, and the Santo Domingo and Sarmiento families accumulate 57% of the market.This interdependence particularly between newspaper El Tiempo of Luis Carlos Sarmiento and the government of President Ivan Duque became particularly evident last year when the two exchanged executives.Media groups and companies also often financially support electoral campaigns. Their support for one candidate then again has influence on the media coverage of those elections. On the regional level, this phenomenon seems to work as a trait – the winning candidate puts the public advertising into the media outlets, which supported his election.Reporters Without BordersPress freedom foundation FLIP warned last year that the increasingly blurry lines between mass media and government threatened the democratic character of Colombia.‘Democratic character of Colombia’s state put to the test’: press freedom foundationThreat 3: Ivan DuqueThe RSF confirmed that the government has increasingly become a threat to the freedom of press.Since conservative politician Ivan Duque’s installation as president in August 2018, journalists and media outlets have been the targets of harassment and intimidation campaigns and espionage after reporting that members of his government had been involved in fraud, corruption and human rights violations.Reporters Without BordersWith the help of government officials, followers of former President Alvaro Uribe have regularly embarked on  smear campaigns against journalists, particularly after the Supreme Court began investigating Duque’s far-right political patron over alleged fraud and bribery.The military has been accused of terrorizing journalists of weekly Semana who were investigating corruption and human rights violations inside the military. medianewsletterPress freedomReporters Without Borders ",https://colombiareports.com/press-freedom-in-colombia-deteriorated-in-2019-amid-persistent-aggression-and-self-censorship/,Press freedom in Colombia deteriorated in 2019 amid persistent aggression and self-censorship

" Colombia’s prison chief has barely been in office for half a year and is already facing multiple criminal charges amid accusations of sadism and intimidation.According to W Radio, prison guard Freiman Perez of La Picota’s prison in the capital Bogota filed the criminal charges against General Norberto Mujica, who took office in October after his predecessor was suspected of helping a politician break prison.Perez claimed that the prison chief knew of a coronavirus outbreak in Villavicencio and was aware of media reports in which lawmakers warned that an outbreak in La Picota would cause “carnage.”INPEC previously said that the two were transferred as a disciplinary measure because they took part in unrest sparked by prisoners’ fear that the substandard conditions in Villavicencio made them vulnerable to coronavirus infections.Since then, three inmates have died and 20 were confirmed to be infected in Villavicencio, which has an overcrowding rate of 90% and inmates have access to water only three hours a day.Colombia says at least 23 killed, 91 injured in mass prison riotsPrison chief knowingly spreading coronavirus?The transfers took place after the March 23 lockdown of the prisons, allowing Justice Minister Margarita Cabello to struggle to formulate a decree to release non-violent prisoners from overcrowded and unhygienic prisons.The accusation that Mujica in the meantime was knowingly moving infected patients around is only the latest raising serious doubts over the prison chief while tensions inside the penitentiaries are coming to a boil.INPEC Major Jose Joaquin Peña and the Bogota prison’s head nurse, Diana Gamboa, on Saturday confirmed on Twitter that Mujica and the director of La Picota knew they were transferring infected prisoners.The two officials additionally accused the INPEC chief of lying that security measures had been put in place in La Picota to prevent compromising the lives and health of both the prisoners and guards.The officials said that the two infected prisoners had been in constant contact with other inmates, prison guards and administrative personnel.Mujica accused of sadism and intimidationPrison guard union leader Johan Alarcon, accused Mujica of intimidating INPEC officials and sadism.According to Alarcon, three prisoners were confirmed infected with the coronavirus of whom two died. The union leader said the prisoners were forced to raffle over who would get the one mask available.Alarcon’s claims confirmed his colleagues’ claims they were never provided with personal protection equipment.“The few things we have obtained have been through collections from the officials themselves,” the union leader said.In response, Mujica told prison directors that “anyone who makes such a statement will be criminally prosecuted,” defense attorney Miguel Angel del Rio said.“We won’t allow this,” said the attorney after which multiple prison guards announced both criminal and disciplinary charges.Mujicavirus keeps spreadingWhile Mujica is facing a growing number of complaints and even criminal charges, the prison in Florencia, the capital of the southern Caqueta prison, announced that the coronavirus had been confirmed there.Also in Florencia, the coronavirus arrived after the transfer of a prisoner from Villavicencio, according to local authorities.Caqueta Health Secretary Lilibeth Galvan went even further than the prison guards and said “these orders come from the national government” whose justice minister apparently has transferred more infected prisoners than anything else. coronavirusInpecNorberto Mujicaprisons ",https://colombiareports.com/six-months-in-office-and-colombias-prison-chief-already-facing-criminal-charges/,Six months in office and Colombia’s prison chief already facing criminal charges

" The main hospital in Choco, Colombia’s largest province on the Pacific coast, largely shut down on Saturday after almost all personnel went into quarantine after a coronavirus outbreak.The San Francisco de Asis hospital in Quibdo will only be able to carry out surgeries and births as the remaining staff will go into a 14-day quarantine after at least three workers tested positive for the virus.Choco’s Health Secretary confirmed the outbreak weeks after the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC) reported a shortage in the most basic personal protection equipment in hospitals throughout the country.The shutdown of the hospital is a disaster for Quibdo and the surrounding communities as the province’s largest medical facility was meant to be the main recipient of patients during the pandemic.With the San Francisco de Asis hospital closed, only the much smaller Ismael Roldan Valencia hospital remains to provide healthcare in the city of 130,000 people.Epidemiologist Diego Lucumi, who worked in Choco until seven years ago, told newspaper El Tiempo that the virtual shutdown of the hospital puts the province’s entire healthcare system in a critical situation.The entire regional infrastructure to deal with the coronavirus relied on the San Francisco de Asis hospital, according to Lucumi.With hundreds of healthcare workers “out of combat,” Choco is left unable to deal with either the coronavirus or provide any healthcare, the epidemiologist told the newspaper.The point is that to Chocó’s structural health care problems you add the coronavirus emergency, and now you lose a lot of qualified personnel and its only large hospital. It’s ironic, the hospital becomes the least safe place. Not only the coronavirus, but the care of any other condition that requires a hospital is going to be complicated.Epidemiologist Diego LucumiTo add insult to injury, the hospital workers who were sent home complained last week they hadn’t been paid for more than four months and, like most hospitals in Colombia, were short of basic protection equipment.Just a few days ago, the FMC withdrew its confidence in Health Minister Fernando Ruiz for allegedly failing to keep his word about providing protection equipment and improving labor conditions for health workers.The national government didn’t immediately respond to the health crisis in Choco.

" Colombia’s government transferred coronavirus emergency stipends of $41 to 16,000 ghost accounts, the country’s National Registrar said Tuesday.This would mean the National Planning Department (DNP) misallocated at least $660,000 in emergency funds that were meant to help the poor through an ongoing quarantine.After citizens found that money had been sent to ghost accounts, The DNP closed the portal where people could verify if they were granted a stipend, claiming “there was an anomaly that is being overcome.”In an interview with Semana columnist Vicky Davila, National Registrar Alexander Vega said his office was still investigating the biggest scandal involving disappearing aid funds so far.Before Vega had finished his interview  Blu Radio reported that the army signed a contract for personal protection equipment worth $50,000 that included multiple overpriced items, most notably masks that cost 60 cents, but were bought for $15.Comptroller General Carlos Felipe Cordoba previously announced that multiple governor’s offices and city halls had signed similar contracts in which they agreed to buy products well above market value as government officials of all kinds appear to turn the global pandemic into a get-rich-quick scheme.Colombia’s great coronavirus heist: Part 1 | Let the robbing beginCordoba, Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa and Inspector General Fernando Carrillo teamed up weeks ago to audit and prosecute corruption after the government of President Ivan Duque announced emergency aid.Vice-President Marta Lucia Ramirez said Monday she would be leading this “anti-corruption elite squad,” but was quickly reminded the investigative bodies are independent and not interested in government interference.Even under normal circumstances, corruption costs the government approximately 10% of its annual budget, according to the country’s former Comptroller General.The crisis situation caused by the coronavirus and the large sums of money Bogota is sending to all corners of the country makes the risk of corruption even bigger. coronaviruscorruption ",https://colombiareports.com/colombias-great-coronavirus-heist-part-2-government-sent-660000-to-ghost-accounts/,"Colombia’s great coronavirus heist: Part 2 | Government sent $660,000 to ghost accounts"
" Colombia’s health minister confirmed on Thursday that the government plans to lift quarantine measures for “certain sectors of the economy” while maintaining a general lockdown.In a virtual session with Congress, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz confirmed President Ivan Duque’s plans to “recover productive life without social life” on April 27 when the current quarantine ends.The strategy will be to maintain the obligatory preventive lockdown for specific groups and maintain the obligatory preventive lockdown for the entire population with the option of a very systematic, very gradual and very controlled global opening of some sectors of the economy.Health Minister Fernando RuizThe health minister would not not say which sectors of the economy the government is considering exempting from the quarantine and stressed that any relaxation would be reversed if the National Health Institute (INS) registered a surge in coronavirus contagion.Colombia’s coronavirus testing falters as Duque tried to pitch economic restartThe problem with the INS is that it has been unable to carry out enough tests to give the government a reliable indication of the spread of the virus in Colombia.Ruiz admitted that he estimated some 12,000 people have been infected so far, a number almost four times as high as the infections confirmed by the INS.Relaxing the quarantine is a sensitive issue in Colombia because the healthcare system was already on the brink of collapse before the coronavirus pandemic.Medical personnel said earlier on Thursday that they had lost confidence in the health minister after he failed to keep his word to provide hospitals with personal protection equipment.Colombia’s medical community withdraws confidence in health ministerDuque, however, has been under pressure from powerful corporations and business associations that are suffering financially in what Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla has already called “the worst year in the country’s economic history.”Whether helping these specific private interests would improve the country’s economic malaise is uncertain as, according to the IMF, the entire world entered in a recession without any indication there could be an improvement before the second half of next year. coronavirusFernando ruiz ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-plans-to-relax-quarantine-for-certain-sectors-of-the-economy/,Colombia plans to relax quarantine for ‘certain sectors of the economy’

" Factories in Colombia’s second largest city Medellin are set to mass produce ventilators after local scientists and engineers were able to design and test the life-saving medical machines in a month.It’s almost impossible to overstate the importance of the success of the #InnspiraMED project whose ventilators have already received a medical license.Once the first of three prototypes passes the test on a human being on Monday, two Medellin factories will immediately begin the production of the low-cost ventilators that are desperately needed in hospitals.By the end of May, the initial mass production will have added 1,500 life-saving oxygen providers to the estimated 5,000 ventilators for adults currently in use in the country’s hospitals.Because the developers used open source techniques, other factories are able to add production capacity if necessary.Until now, nobody in Colombia had the technology to produce these complex machines that aren’t even available in hospitals in the poorest parts of the country.Medellin medical engineer Mauricio Toro took the initiative in March, receiving almost immediate support from the local University of Antioquia, the CES University and local innovation institute Ruta N.Within a week, Toro was able to report that the mechanics of the ventilators were working.Colombia close to having world’s first open source and low-cost ventilator to ‘beat Covid-19’Project leader Luis Horacio Atehortua, the Intensive Care coordinator of the local San Vicente hospital, reported on Friday that the ventilators had passed the penultimate test on animals.Medical licensing institute Invima approved the production and use of the ventilators later that day.Haceb, a Medellin company that usually produces refrigerators, and Sofasa, the producer of Renault cars in Colombia, have begun the preparation of their mass production facilities to begin the production of ventilators instead of fridges and cars.The coronavirus pandemic is expected to saturate the country’s medical capacity, and in particular its ICU’s, in five to six weeks, around the time the first respirators with “Made in Colombia” stamped on them will be leaving the factories. coronavirushealthcarenewslettertechnology ",https://colombiareports.com/colombia-able-to-mass-produce-ventilators-after-medellin-project-proves-success/,Colombia able to mass-produce ventilators after Medellin project proves successful
" Colombia’s government went into overdrive on Sunday after medical personnel threatened to lay down work over back payments and life-threatening working conditions.President Ivan Duque ordered his ministers to guarantee that all medical personnel are paid, some of whom haven’t been paid in four months.We have decided on a 72-hour deadline, that is, next Wednesday. This has to be totally defined: what payment is going where and who is going to deliver it.Labor Minister Angel CustodiaThe president announced a $1.5 billion emergency capital injection into the health system, but reportedly sent this money to notoriously corrupt health intermediaries, called EPSs, who owe hospitals much more than that.The Colombian Medical Federation and the opposition had urged  to send the money not to these notoriously corrupt enterprises, but to the hospitals instead, but to no avail, according to the director Colombian Medical College (CMG).Now, nobody knows where the money is, except that it never got to to the doctors and nurses, and life-saving medical gear like masks and protective clothing continue to be a scarcity if they even exist in most hospitals.Colombia’s hospitals unprepared for coronavirus, personnel working under threat: federationDuque entered in panic mode on Sunday after the director of the Colombian Medical Federation (FMC), Sergio Isaza, told news website KienyKe that doctors and nurses are considering walking out.The doctors have mentioned that they will not go to the ‘slaughterhouse’ without protection, they stress that their life is put on the line and without any economic security, which would be a problem, but if you analyze well it is like suicide.FMC president Sergio Isaza“We know the government is making a major effort, but the supplies still haven’t arrived,” according to CMG director Roberto Baquero.Doctors in the northern city of Cartagena reportedly already resigned last week after the FMC had already warned  that hospitals, laboratories and other medical facilities were not just failing to pay personnel, but firing those who were getting paid if they didn’t accept wage cuts.

" Colombia’s notoriously optimistic finance minister said Sunday that his country is facing “the worst year in the economic history of the country.”In an interview with newspaper El Espectador, Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla said that he had lowered his economic growth projection from +3.7% to between -1.5% and -2%.This would be the first contraction of the economy since the country’s financial crisis in 1999 that triggered the bankruptcy of multiple banks and mass home evictions.This will be one of the worst years, if not the worst, in our economic history.Finance Minister Alberto CarrasquillaBlow after blow after shot in the footBefore the coronavirus pandemic became an issue, Carrasquilla was already confronted with another major blow, a major reduction in global oil prices as a consequence of an oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia.On top of that, the finance minister last year gave a major tax discount to corporations against the advice of economists who warned this alone would lead to $2.3 billion losses in tax revenue.The current quarantine costs approximately $516 million a day. The economic contraction expected by Carrasquilla would lead to the loss of $2.6 billion in tax revenue.The finance minister told the newspaper he was considering another tax reform to recover at least the expected tax revenue losses.Carrasquilla said last week he also reached out to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to obtain an $11 billion loan to restart the economy and fill the gaping holes in his budget.This means much more debt and it is a debt that we have to pay once we get over this tragedy.Finance Minister Alberto CarrasquillaOnly insecurity aheadWhile certain the country is facing a crisis year, the finance minister said he couldn’t guess how long this crisis will last as the entire world economy has gone into recession.No one in the world is in a position to estimate what will happen next, but we have prepared ourselves to face strong tensions in the financial system.Finance Minister Alberto CarrasquillaCarrasquilla stressed that there is only so much the government and the central bank can do as the crisis is global and Colombia will have to adapt to to developments in the global economy.
