" One of Colombia’s most notorious war lords has begun testifying before the war crimes tribunal about the now-defunct paramilitary organization AUC.War crimes tribunal JEP heard Rodrigo Tovar in order to decide whether to allow the former AUC commander into the transitional justice system.The JEP ordered extra hearings before deciding if Tovar’s contribution to the truth about the armed conflict merits the judicial benefits granted to those who submit before the transitional justice system.The secrets of ‘Jorge 40’, the warlord who owned Colombia’s Caribbean regionTovar’s problematic cooperation with justiceThe transitional justice system that tried paramilitary war crimes stripped the former AUC commander of such benefits in 2015 for his failures to cooperate.Tovar stopped cooperating with Colombian justice after his surprise extradition to the United States in 2008 and the assassination of his brother in 2009.The former war lord’s defense said that prison authority INPEC had been obstructing Tovar’s cooperation with the JEP since his repatriation in 2020.The former AUC chief additionally said that ongoing prosecution investigations impeded him to confess crimes without incriminating himself.Colombia wants paramilitary chiefs in prison, not testifying in courtTovar’s distrust in justiceJEP magistrate Sandra Castro (L) (Image: JEP)In order to allow the Tovar to testify freely, JEP magistrate Sandra Castro agreed to make parts of the hearings confidential.Castro additionally said she would order INPEC to facilitate confidential meetings between the former paramilitary commander and his lawyers.The decisions of the JEP ended Tovar’s reluctance to talks about his collaboration with the AUC between 1996 and 1998.The JEP may assume investigations into Tovar’s war crimes between 1998 and the Northern Bloc’s demobilization in 2006 if the war crimes tribunal decides the former AUC commander has been cooperative.The Northern Bloc’s victimsThe Prosecutor General’s Office said in 2020 that it was carrying out almost 1,500 criminal investigations against the former paramilitary commander.According to the National Center for Historical Memory, the Northern Bloc left more than 17,000 victims between 1996 and 2006 when Tovar demobilized his fighters.

" Police and prosecutors in Colombia continue to investigate who ordered the assassination of one of Paraguay’s top anti-mafia prosecutors in May last year.Police in Colombia, Venezuela and El Salvador have arrested 10 alleged participants in the plot to assassinate Paraguayan prosecutor Marcelo Pecci on May 10 last year.Police and the Prosecutor General’s Office claim that associates of the Medellin mafia took a week to recruit an assassin squad and plan Pecci’s assassination in the Caribbean city of Cartagena.Who ordered an financed the hit has yet to be clarified, however, especially after the extradition of one of the main suspects from El Salvador on Saturday.The Colombo-Venezuelan hit squadMargareth Chacon (Image: El Salvador’s Justice and Public Security Ministry)Following the extradition of Margareth Chacon, nine of the members of the Colombo-Venezuelan hit squad are in jail in Colombia and one in Venezuela.Chacon arrived in Bogota almost a week after the arrest of her husband, Andres Perez, and her brother-in-law, Ramon Perez.The Perez brothers plead guilty to homicide after seeing compelling evidence indicating that they coordinated the 10-day operation that ended Pecci’s life with Chacon.The latest detainee denied her involvement in the assassination plot.The intelligence operationThe Perez brothers (Image: Prosecutor General’s Office)Chacon and the Perez brothers were arrested after a six-month intelligence operation by police intelligence unit DIJIN and the prosecution’s Technical Investigation Unit.The three weren’t considered suspects until the arrest of the assassination squad’s alleged logistics chief, Francisco Luis Correa, in June last year.The Perez brothers knew Correa because they used to be members of the now-defunct paramilitary group “Los Paisas,”  according to the prosecution.Shortly after his arrest, Correa told investigators that Ramon Perez called him about a “job” on April 30 last year and specified that the job was killing Pecci during a meeting in Medellin two days later.Pecci had to die “because the prosecutor was being a nuisance for their boss” in Paraguay, according to Correa’s testimony.He imprisoned his brother for four years and the prosecutor was going after his assets and drug trafficking, they told me.Correa testimonyFollowing Correa’s accusations, DIJIN had a second look at CCTV footage from Cartagena, which allegedly confirmed that Chacon and the Perez brothers were in Cartagena on the day of Pecci’s assassination.In the meantime, intelligence officials began tracking the movements of Chacon and the Perez brothers.Migration Colombia’s registry showed that Chacon had traveled to El Salvador more than 100 times and had traveled to Venezuela and Panama on multiple occasions.According to DIJIN, Chacon frequently wired money from El Salvador to her husband in Bogota, suggesting that she may not be the housewife that she claimed to be.The leads abroadThe evidence and testimonies against Chacon and the Perez brothers suggest that they are part of an drug trafficking network that doesn’t just operate in Paraguay, but throughout Latin America.Two days after the assassination, former National Police director Jorge Luis Vargas said that the PCC, an organized crime group from Brazil, was suspected of ordering the assassination of Pecci.In August, President Gustavo Petro said that fugitive Uruguayan drug trafficker Sebastian Marset had ordered the murder.Marset, an alleged boss of the First Uruguayan Cartel (PCU), rejected this allegation.Last week, newspaper El Tiempo reported that authorities suspected Miguel Insfran, a fugitive PCU boss from Paraguay. of having ordered Pecci’s assassination.According to El Tiempo, its intelligence sources believed that Insfran may be hiding in Colombia’s northern La Guajira province.The latest narco who allegedly ordered the Cartagena hit may just as well have fled to Venezuela or El Salvador, the newspaper reported.Meanwhile, authorities have yet to speculate about the origin of the $320,000 the Perez brothers allegedly gave Correa to finance the assassination.

" Colombia’s government and guerrilla group ELN said Saturday that they have overcome tensions caused by President Gustavo Petro’s false claim that the rebels had agreed to a bilateral ceasefire.The government and rebel negotiators made the statement after improvised negotiations in the Venezuelan capital Caracas to end what the ELN called a “crisis” in the peace talks.In a joint statement, the negotiators agreed to negotiate a bilateral ceasefire once formal talks resume in Mexico on February 13.Government negotiator Otty Patiño additionally said that the extra talks allowed a “more optimistic” second round of talks that will begin on February 13 in Mexico.According to UN Colombia chief Carlos Ruiz, the talks “demonstrated again that dialogue is the way forward.”Progress so farPeace commissioner Danilo Rueda (Image: Peace Commissioner’s Office)The Petro administration and the ELN resumed formal peace talks in Caracas in November after a four-year suspension ordered by former President Ivan Duque in 2018.The negotiators initially agreed that the talks would stick to the agenda that was agreed between the rebels and former President Juan Manuel Santos in early 2017.The negotiators did agree on a “humanitarian corridor” that allowed approximately 100 independent observers to travel to a war-torn region in western Colombia to inspect the humanitarian situation there.Colombia’s ELN guerrillas claim ceasefire triggered crisis in peace talksWhat about the ceasefire?Government negotiator Otty Patiño (Screenshot: Twitter)While in Caracas, the ELN negotiators agreed to include ceasefire negotiations to the agenda of the second round.The government provisionally agreed to ceasefires that took force on January 1 with four other illegal groups.Groups upholding ceasefireAGCSoutheastern Bloc / OCCLos PachencaSegunda MarquetaliaThe government and the illegal armed groups have yet to agree on a verification system that would allow independent observers to monitor compliance with the ceasefires though.The lack of this verification system has already caused tensions over alleged violations of the ceasefires by the guerrilla and paramilitary groups that did agree to a bilateral ceasefire.Colombia’s FARC dissidents captured 5 soldiers during ceasefire: militaryComplications for peaceChief prosecutor Francisco Barbosa (Image: Prosecutor General’s Office)These tensions increased last week when Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa said that he would refuse to lift the arrest warrants of delegates of the AGC and Los Pachenca.Barbosa’s opposition to Petro’s “Total Peace” plans makes talks with Colombia’s largest paramilitary organization and the Caribbean drug trafficking organization impossible.The possible demobilization of the AGC and Los Pachenca are delicate because they could reveal ties between the paramilitaries and the drug traffickers with Colombia’s security forces and elites. armed conflictceasefireELNpeace talks ",Colombia’s government and ELN rebels overcome “crisis” in peace talks
" The human rights agency of the Organization of American States called on Colombia’s authorities to release people who were jailed for their participation in anti-government protests in 2021.In a report, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (IACHR) urged on Colombian authorities to release people who were unjustly jailed for their participation in the so-called “National Strike.”The office of Prosecutor General Francisco Barbosa has been investigating hundreds of people who took part in the largely peaceful protests on all kinds of criminal charges, including terrorism.At least 150 people would still be in jail as a consequence of what human rights organizations and President Gustavo Petro have called a “persecution” of participants in the protests against former President Ivan Duque, one of Barbosa’s best friends.The recommendation to the competent authorities is to review the situation of those persons who may have been arbitrarily detained, so that they can follow these processes in freedom, with alternative measures to imprisonment that continue to allow the advancement of justice, but with greater participation of the people.IACHR representative Joel HernandezIs Colombia’s top mafia prosecutor targeting kids or gangsters?Deadly police violenceDuring the protests between April and July 2021, police arbitrarily arrested thousands of protesters and took part in the killing of at least 74 protesters, according to human rights organizations.In response to the violent crackdown, the IACHR investigated the alleged human rights violations and in July 2021 made 41 recommendations that would guarantee citizens’ right to protest peacefully.In a follow-up report on the progress of 28 of these recommendations, the agency found that only three recommendations were implemented substantially, 14 were partially implemented and 11 were pending implementation.‘Police used Bogota bus terminals to torture protesters’Persecution of protestersThe prosecution’s alleged persecution of protesters and refusal to investigate the police brutality during the protests have escalated tensions between Barbosa and human rights organizations.According to Alberto Yepes of the NGO Coordination Colombia-Europe-United States, 27 people were still missing and that the prosecution refused to investigate missing persons reports because they lacked data.Another 23 people were found dead after they went missing, human rights organization Defender La Libertad told Colombia Reports.Barbosa attacks human rights defendersBarbosa confirmed that the prosecution never investigated 195 missing persons reports because they “lacked information.”The chief prosecutor accused the NGO’s of “trying to torpedo the institutionality” by including 300 people “who never had gone missing” on a list of 625 missing persons that was given to the prosecution.According to Barbosa, none of the people who had been reported missing were ever in danger, ignoring the allegations that almost two dozen were found dead.Why so many people went missingThe vast majority of people who were reported as missing in the first weeks of the protests apparently could not be located because they had been arrested by police and detained in make-shift jails.According to Defender La Libertad, other people who reappeared said they were held hostage in police vans. human rightsnational strikeProsecutor General's Office ",OAS urges Colombia to release people arrested over 2021 protests
" Colombia’s armed forces have said that five soldiers were “kidnapped” by guerrillas since a bilateral ceasefire took force on January 1.One of the soldiers has been released and four are allegedly being held captive by the “Southeastern Bloc,” which agreed to suspend attacks on the security forces.The CCO, a division of the Southeastern Bloc, confirmed the capture of one of the soldiers in a proof of life video that was released last week.All soldiers were detained by guerrilla units while passing through guerrilla-controlled territory on leave.The “kidnappings” put pressure on the six-month ceasefire ahead of the creation of a mechanism that would allow the verification of alleged violations.The risks and opportunities of ceasefires with Colombia’s illegal armed groupsThe detained soldiersThe National Army announced on Monday that members of the “Carlos Patiño Front,” one of the CCO’s main guerrilla units in southwest Colombia, kidnapped three soldiers in the Cauca province.Carlos Andres Ocoro, Cristian Murillo and Jose Arcadio Epiayu were allegedly detained at a guerrilla checkpoint on the road between Pasto, the capital of the Nariño province, and Cauca capital Popayan.The soldiers were stationed in the Pacific port city of Tumaco and traveling to Popayan by bus, according to the army.The captive sergeantSergeant Juan Gabriel Chichanoy was also detained in Cauca by members of the Carlos Patiño Front on January 10 while traveling to Pasto.In a proof of life video apparently released by the CCO, Chichanoy said Friday that he was being treated well and expected that he would be reunited with his family “very soon.”The sergeant apparently was granted a leave while being transferred from Florencia, the capital of the southern Caqueta province, to Bucaramanga, the capital of the central Santander province.The released soldierSoldier Luis Domingo Morelo was released to human rights officials on Thursday, hours after he was being detained by guerrillas in Santa Rosa del Sur, a town in northern Bolivar province.The army said Morelo had been kidnapped by members of the 37th Front, a unit that belongs to the “Segunda Marquetalia,” a guerrilla group that is also upholding a bilateral ceasefire.This soldier was also detained while on leave.According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, Morelo was in good health after his release, which was contradicted by the National Army that said the soldier’s health was “weak.”The growing tensionsThe alleged kidnappings put pressure on the ceasefire between the military and the two organizations of former members of the now-defunct guerrilla group FARC.The main peace official of the Cauca province, Gustavo Andres Gonzalez, urged the guerrillas to release the captive soldiers and urged the government to come up with a mechanism that would allow the verification of alleged violations of the ceasefire.The Armed Forces have condemned the “kidnappings,” but has yet to accuse the FARC dissidents of violating the ceasefire.Why the military has allowed soldiers to travel through areas controlled by the FARC dissident groups is unclear. armed conflictceasefireFARC dissidentskidnappingpeace talks ",Colombia’s FARC dissidents captured 5 soldiers during ceasefire: military
" Colombia’s police spied on Russian and Cuban embassy personnel and their families between 2016 and 2019, according to evidence obtained by Noticias Uno.The leaked documents did not reveal if the spying operations resulted in any information that would suggest that the diplomats and their family members were engaged in anything out of the ordinary, according to Noticias Uno.“Operation Catedra”Russian embassy in Bogota (Image: Google Maps)The spying operation targeting against the Russians involved the shadowing of three diplomats, their wives and their children.The police began intercepting the phones of the Russian embassy’s second secretary, Denis Viktorovich Khromov, and everyone he called since September 2016.The spying began months before evidence emerged indicating that Russian intelligence agencies were trying to meddle in the American presidential elections of November 2016.TargetsDenis Viktorovich KhromovAleksander Nikolayevich BelousovOleg Yuryevich EremeyevOne of targets in the reported spying operation, Aleksander Nikolayevich Belousov, was declared a persona non grata in December 2020 on claims the diplomat a member of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service.This allegation followed a two-year DNI operation called “Enigma,” which began in 2018, government-loyal news media El Tiempo and Semana reported at the time.During Operation Catedra, police intelligence agents dressed up as street vendors to spy on the homes of the Russian diplomats.The agency planted listening devices in a hotel in Melgar ahead of a September 2017 trip of 16 Russian embassy workers to the central Colombian town.Police additionally spied on 20 Colombian citizens, including five university professors, who had studied in Russia.‘There are no Russians under your beds,’ ambassador tells ColombiaOperation MatiasCuban embassy in Bogota (Image: Google Maps)At least 10 Cuban embassy workers in Bogota were profiled as part of “Operation Matias,” which allegedly investigated “Cuban interference” in Colombia.Also during this operation, intelligence officials dressed up as street vendors to identify the embassy workers, their vehicles and their homes.The intelligence agents also threatened to link one of the embassy’s cleaning ladies to terrorism in “Operation Vodka,” which sought to “obtain classified, convenient and truthful information” from inside the embassy.The embassy worker was initially seduced by an intelligence official, who was subsequently accused of being involved in a June 2017 bomb attack on the Andino mall in Bogota, according to Noticias Uno.The police additionally offered the worker’s family grants from “Cero de Siempre,” a child welfare program that was coordinated by the President’s Office with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank.The embassy worker ceded and agreed to “enter devices and extract information from the building where control targets are located (access to security cameras, and rooms throughout the complex).”The police carried out the spying operations while the Cuban government was hosting peace talks between the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos and guerrilla groups FARC and ELN.Neither the Russian nor the Cuban embassies responded immediately to the reported spying operations that allegedly ended without results in 2019.
